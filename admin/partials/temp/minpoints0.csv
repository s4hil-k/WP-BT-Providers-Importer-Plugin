Dr. Morses own medical history has motivated him to be in the profession where he can help prevent, diagnose and treat others. Diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age 17, Dr. Morse has an understanding and compassion for his patients that is fueled by his drive to help people.Born in 1980 in Corvallis, Oregon, Dr.  Morse has spent most of his life in Eugene. He attended the University of Oregon for two years and followed up with his Business Administration degree at the University of West Florida. While not feeling like his life was on the correct path, he soon started studying at the nationally accredited National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon. He graduated in June 2009 with a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine. He now runs Absolute Health Medical Center with his wife and team of Naturopathic oriented healthcare professionals.As a Licensed Primary Care Physician, Dr.  Morse can prescribe most pharmaceuticals, order labs, refer to a specialist and act as your primary Dr. . Along with treating many acute conditions like the common cold and flu, Dr. Morse sees many conditions ranging from diabetes to fibromyalgia. Using therapies that boost your bodys ability to heal, many conditions can be improved. Bio-identical hormones and Dr. MorseAfter a short amount of time of being in practice, Dr. Morse realized the value in his training with managing hormones.  He saw that many men and women are poorly managed on thyroid hormone as well as our reproductive hormones (Testosterone, Estrogen, and Progesterone).He began seeing more and more women being put on synthetic estrogens without testosterone or progesterone therapy included.  This lack of comprehensive treatment can lead to cancer, weight gain, depression, and many other symptoms.  The worst of it all is when women are put on NO hormones after a full hysterectomy.  This sets them up for osteoporosis much earlier in life as well as greatly increasing their risk of a heart attacks!  Dr. Morse strongly believes in giving the body what it needs.  This includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, other nutrients and most importantly HORMONES!!!  Giving bio-identical hormones in safe doses that keep lab ranges at optimal numbers, people can live longer and happier lives through an improved quality of life!","","","e38316012d7128b5","468","276","1\/18\/14","0","0","0","morsend@gmail.com; heidi.absolutehealth@gmail.com"

Laura has worked as a patient care nurse and nursing supervisor.  She was a nurse manager for the third busiest hospital in the Houston area.Having spent many long years in the allopathic traditional system of medicine and seeing so many unresolved cases, Laura believes in Optimal Health, Natural Choices and Natural Medicine.  To see the system fail in so many places, there had to be something more.  Instead of trying to treat the symptoms, what happened to finding out the cause and working in such a way to help the body heal?Her desire to help patients improve their health and look at a more holistic approach to patient care, Laura returned to school and is now a certified adult primary care nurse practitioner.  A nurse practitioner plays an important role in helping patients with education, prevention of illness, and encouraging wellness.  Nurse practitioners use less drugs than medical doctors and provide high-quality cost-effective personalized healthcare by treating the whole person.  I think of my role as a functional provider like that of an investigatorwhat is the cause.  I find it is rarely one thing going on.  I love the challenge, but most importantly, it is helping my patients get better. While Laura can write prescriptions for pharmaceutical drugs, she will most often work with diet, life-style modifications, and nutraceuticals first.Some of the services she provides include:Hormone optimization for men and womenWellness visitsLab work, x-rays, and other diagnostic testsLyme disease managementPrimary careGynecological exams (including pap smears)Joint injectionsMinor proceduresSkin biopsiesMinor emergenciesWalk-ins are always welcomeLaura also provides IV nutrition and advanced laboratory testing of hormones, thyroid, gastrointestinal and neurotransmitter areas.Laura graduated from Crystal River High School and obtained her Registered Nursing degree from the College of Central Florida.

In 1988, he married  his high-school sweetheart and began the educational process that would eventually lead to his medical degree.  Dr. Eldore and his wife have four children ranging in age from late teens to  mid-twenties.  He is a dedicated husband and father and loves, above all else, spending time with his wife and children. Dr. Eldore graduated from Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995. Afterwards, he and his family moved to Temple, Texas to complete his  OB\/GYN residency training program at Scott and White Hospital until 1999. He spent the next 4 years practicing medicine in The United States Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. His desire to return to Texas brought him to Athens in 2003, where he planted roots, raised his family, and has owned and operated Athens Women's & Children's Center ever since.Driven by a desire to develop new skills and help his patients in different ways, Dr. Eldore developed an increasing interest and involvement in aesthetic treatments. In 2006, he began serving as medical director for a local aesthetics practice, owned by Julie Harrell LE, CLT and began administering Botox and Juvederm after receiving hands on training in California. In 2009, Dr. Eldore and Ms. Harrell opened Ageless Image, a medical spa in Athens.  Ageless Image is now the premier med-spa in the region and, together, Dr. Eldore and Julie offer essentially all types of aesthetic, hormonal, and wellness services for men and women.In 2012, Dr. Eldore was introduced to bio-identical hormone therapy using pellet implants.  He quickly became fascinated with this therapy and, with great excitement, he incorporated it into his medical practice.  The powerful benefits, the prolonged effectiveness, and the ease of administration made estrogen and testosterone pellet therapy an instant hit and, before long, hundreds of patients throughout the region were receiving hormone pellet therapy through his practice.  He now focuses a large amount of time and effort on providing BioTE, an incredible hormone replacement solution for fatigue, sexual dysfunction, mood elevation\/stabilization, vasomotor symptoms ( hot flushes, etc. ), genitourinary atrophy, sleep disruption, weight gain, and much more.  Dr. Eldore is the area expert on bio-identical hormone therapy and, due to the success and rapid growth of his hormone therapy clientele, he was chosen to help provide clinical training to new BioTE physicians and practitioners from around the nation at the companys corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas.  Over the last several years, Dr. Eldore has provided essential training and insight to scores of BioTE trainees.  He considers it an honor and a privilege to be able to be part of the process that is spreading the availability of BioTE throughout the nation and beyond.

I grew up in Becket, Massachusetts, a small town in the Berkshires. I have been blessed to have wonderful parents who have given me the support and strength to follow my dreams and taught me strong family values.Being a doctor is a desire that Ive had since I was 12 years old. I graduated from St. Georges University School of Medicine in 1997 and completed my medical student rotations in Brooklyn New York and my residency training in at St, Josephs Medical Center in Yonkers, NY in 2001. My passion to provide comprehensive healthcare and to use wellness to keep away illness led me to choose family practice as my discipline. I became board-certified in family medicine in 2003.I met my husband in medical school and have been happily married since 1996. We moved to Ashland, Kentucky with our two boys in 2005. I enjoy the small town atmosphere and strong sense of community this area has to offer. I have had the privilege of working for almost 10 years in the Kings Daughters outreach clinic in South point Ohio.It has long been a desire of mine to provide a whole body approach, to not just treat illness but to promote overall health, happiness and well-being. Throughout my career I saw the negative effects that obesity has on the body, mind and spirit. I myself have struggled with obesity my entire life. I also saw the toll that addiction has in our community, many times afflicting young people just as they are getting into the prime of their life.I along with my husband opened our practice, Ashland integrative medicine in 2014 to provide a private, comfortable, family-friendly environment where patients can feel free to address the sensitive issues and help us guide them towards a healthier, more productive life.It is my honor and a privilege to serve all your healthcare needs.","honum007@gmail.com","606-393-6193","c6066d4bd3404dcd","2238","1195","9\/17\/16","0","1","1","angela@aimforchange.net"

It is not surprising that this youthful inclination led her into medical product design, medicine and ultimately plastic surgery. An ambitious student, Dr. Atagi earned dual undergraduate degrees in Design and Product Design engineering at Stanford University.  After graduation, she worked as a biomedical engineer designing and prototyping medical devices.  She was awarded a patent for one of her developments.Her biomedical engineering experience convinced her to pursue her interest in medicine.  She completed a post-baccalaureate curriculum in chemistry and biology at Harvard.  She then returned to Stanford, where she was accepted into medical school and received her doctorate of medicine in 1994.Realizing that plastic surgery was the perfect way to blend many of her professional interests and talents, Dr. Atagi completed an integrated residency training program in plastic and reconstructive surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.  Advanced training followed, including a plastic surgery research fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis, and aesthetic surgery training at Grossman Plastic Surgery in Denver.As a female physician in a typically male dominated specialty, many patients find the option of choosing a board certified woman physician for their care more appealing.  Along with performing many cosmetic surgical procedures, Dr. Atagi has a special interest in breast reconstruction surgery for women with breast cancer.In a survey conducted by 5280 magazine, Dr. Atagi was voted by her peers as one of Denvers top reconstructive surgeons in 2003, and as both top plastic and reconstructive surgeon in 2004, 2005 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.  Dr. Atagi is the author of several articles for professional publications and has conducted research studies on breast implants, breast modeling and related psychological outcomes testing.Dr. Atagi is a member of the Arapahoe Douglas Elbert Medical Society.

MY GOAL IS TO GIVE YOU THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE.Since the age of five, I knew I wanted to be a nurse. I loved caring for my classmates that injured themselves on the playground. In Junior High and High School, I would hide in my grandmothers spare bedroom and read from her medical textbooks. I enjoyed learning about how the body works and attempting to diagnosis my cousins with the conditions Id read about. In high school, I had the opportunity to take a course to become a certified nursing assistant and this was the start of my nursing journey. I worked in various settings and had the opportunity to care for people of all ages throughout the lifespan.  My passion has always been womens health. Just before starting nursing school, I took a course and became certified with the Doulas of North America. I enjoyed being able to work with laboring women and their husbands in their journey to parenthood.  After becoming a registered nurse, I had the opportunity to continue my work in labor and delivery.  The experience of assisting families as they made the transition of adding a new member has left an unforgettable impression upon me.  I chose to pursue an advanced nursing degree and broadened my scope of practice to include caring for the entire family unit. I had the privilege of attending Frontier Nursing University in Hyden, Kentucky. While there, I learned to embrace a holistic approach in seeking and maintaining wellness.  I believe that everyone deserves an individual approach to their care that caters to their unique needs. My goal is to give you the knowledge that allows you to make changes that will improve your health, well-being and quality of life. I have worked in a variety of settings including, medical aesthetics, helping to educate nursing students, bio-identical hormones, and urgent care. These opportunities have allowed me to develop a wide-range of experience in helping to better the lives of those around me. I strive to understand the concerns of those seeking my help and together construct a plan that is attainable. I am thankful for an extremely supportive husband who has always encouraged me to purse my passions.  I am the blessed mother of seven children; five daughters and two sons. I enjoy spending time with them and attending their various activities. I enjoy crocheting, sewing, gardening, canning and playing the piano and organ. I also enjoy serving in a special needs activity program once a week and appreciate the opportunity to mingle among and learn from such amazing people!I believe there is something to learn from every person that we meet.Certification and EducationSalt Lake Community College, AAS, Registered Nurse 2006Frontier Nursing University, MSN, APRN 2013Family Nurse Practitioner, 2013American Nurse Credentialing Center Family Nurse Practitioner CertificationBioTE certification, 2017Basic Life Support Healthcare Provider*       CPR Certified","np@haights.com","801-500-0919","21464e8b749e05b7","3616","1756","8\/5\/17","0","1","1","suzi@avivawoman.com"

","Komar","MD","Dr. Jonathan Komar received his medical degree at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.  He then completed the Residency Program in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) at the University of Washington, one of the top programs in the nation for his specialty.  He then went on to successfully complete a Fellowship Program at Southwest Spine & Sports in Scottsdale, Arizona.  This extra level of training has helped him to gain skill and expertise in the area of state-of-the-art, non-surgical care for spine and musculoskeletal conditions.Specializing in mens care, he is the go-to doctor for the weekend warriors. Inundated by the busy work week schedule, men often use the weekends to pursue high impact and physically demanding outdoor sports activities.  However, when injuries occur, this can start a negative domino effect, leading to a decline in function.  This can be the cause of missed opportunities, not only on the golf course and tennis courts, but in home and work life as well.  Dr. Komars rehabilitation approach is to treat the whole person, which includes optimizing physical, nutritional and mental health.  Physiologically, men and women are different, and men are prone to some injuries more than women.  Additionally, in the area of mens health, there is no one-size fits all approach to treatment, and this is why personalized care for each patient is an essential part of his approach.As a Physiatrist, Dr. Komars goal is to help improve your level of functioning, reduce pain, and get you back to doing what you love to do.  Over the past 13 years, he has developed and perfected his skills by taking a multi-faceted approach to patient care.  Treating musculoskeletal conditions requires incorporating effective and proven tactics, as well as more modern state-of-the-art medicine in a multi-disciplinary approach.  Dr. Komar also has great passion for Regenerative Medicine, particularly because he has personally witnessed the success of this kind of treatment on many of his own patients for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.  Over the past seven years,he has performed hundreds of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections, long before it became a world-wide trend.  Also, as a Clinical Instructor for the Fellowship Program at Southwest Spine and Sports, he provided hands on instruction to numerous physicians in the training program.   Dr. Komars other areas of expertise include spinal injections of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions using x-ray guidance.  He has also performed tens of thousands of peripheral joint injections under ultrasound guidance.  Additionally, he has conducted thousands of exams using Electrodiagnostic Medicine (EMG) throughout his career.  The EMG exam, when performed properly, can guide the clinician to give an accurate and thorough diagnosis, which leads to more effective and appropriate treatment options.  Lastly, Dr. Komar has personally trained and instructed nearly a dozen physicians through each of their year-long intensive training programs, and all of them are successfully utilizing these skills in their own practices and clinics.Dr. Komar has received numerous awards as a physician.  Patients' Choice honored him with the prestigious Compassionate Doctor Certification, one of a select few physicians, for both 2008 and 2011.  Also, he earned the Phoenix Magazine Top Doc for 2011, 2012 and 2014.  Giving back to the community, he helped bring PM&R practitioners together by volunteering his time to serve as the Educational Chair for the Arizona Society of PM&R for four years, and then as the President for another two years.  In addition, he previously held the position of Adjunct Clinical Assistant Professor at Midwestern University from 2006  2016.  In his free time, he enjoys volunteering for The Boy Scouts of America, which his sons are active members of.","drkomar@azsds.com","480-759-1668","","2780","1499","3\/11\/17","0","1","1","clopez@azsds.com; Drkomar@azsds.com"

The BioTE Method has been proven to be safe and effective in hundreds of thousands of patients over many years. This therapy is designed to address symptoms and health concerns produced by declining hormone levels in both women and men. The BioTE Method helps patients feel much better and reduces many of the concerning symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs, such as night sweats, hot flashes, low libido, sleep difficulties, low energy, anxiety, depressed mood, join pains, lack of mental focus plus many more. It also provides many long term health benefits that are documented in the medical and scientific literature which can lead to a higher satisfaction in life. A simple blood test will reveal whether you are a candidate for this therapy and if it could work for you. Dr. Barrick is one of the few physicians in Colorado that practices a non-surgical injection therapy called Prolotherapy. The very most rewarding part of Dr. Barricks medical practice however, is the many wonderful relationships has with his patients.Dr. Barrick has lived and practiced medicine in Colorado Springs for 27 years. He enjoys golfing, biking, and hiking with his family. His proudest accomplishment is raising five wonderful sons with his wife, Sarah.","sjbarrick@hotmail.com","719-522-0707","b4d77f08374135c7","1144","634","4\/11\/15","0","1","1","Asleshasmiles@yahoo.com"

In 1988, he married  his high-school sweetheart and began the educational process that would eventually lead to his medical degree.  Dr. Eldore and his wife have four children ranging in age from late teens to  mid-twenties.  He is a dedicated husband and father and loves, above all else, spending time with his wife and children. Dr. Eldore graduated from Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995. Afterwards, he and his family moved to Temple, Texas to complete his  OB\/GYN residency training program at Scott and White Hospital until 1999. He spent the next 4 years practicing medicine in The United States Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. His desire to return to Texas brought him to Athens in 2003, where he planted roots, raised his family, and has owned and operated Athens Women's & Children's Center ever since.Driven by a desire to develop new skills and help his patients in different ways, Dr. Eldore developed an increasing interest and involvement in aesthetic treatments. In 2006, he began serving as medical director for a local aesthetics practice, owned by Julie Harrell LE, CLT and began administering Botox and Juvederm after receiving hands on training in California. In 2009, Dr. Eldore and Ms. Harrell opened Ageless Image, a medical spa in Athens.  Ageless Image is now the premier med-spa in the region and, together, Dr. Eldore and Julie offer essentially all types of aesthetic, hormonal, and wellness services for men and women.In 2012, Dr. Eldore was introduced to bio-identical hormone therapy using pellet implants.  He quickly became fascinated with this therapy and, with great excitement, he incorporated it into his medical practice.  The powerful benefits, the prolonged effectiveness, and the ease of administration made estrogen and testosterone pellet therapy an instant hit and, before long, hundreds of patients throughout the region were receiving hormone pellet therapy through his practice.  He now focuses a large amount of time and effort on providing BioTE, an incredible hormone replacement solution for fatigue, sexual dysfunction, mood elevation\/stabilization, vasomotor symptoms ( hot flushes, etc. ), genitourinary atrophy, sleep disruption, weight gain, and much more.  Dr. Eldore is the area expert on bio-identical hormone therapy and, due to the success and rapid growth of his hormone therapy clientele, he was chosen to help provide clinical training to new BioTE physicians and practitioners from around the nation at the companys corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas.  Over the last several years, Dr. Eldore has provided essential training and insight to scores of BioTE trainees.

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology\/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the bodys inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients, and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.","pa@west2northsd.com","951-302-2000","bce3db3a20780832","2535","1764","8\/5\/17","0","1","0","marshall3kids@gmail.com"

She helps replace stress, fear, anxiety in her patients and instills a sense of inner calm and peace by educating and inspiring them to take proactive steps towards health and healing. She has helped thousands of people transform their lives through the ways they think, feel, and act.Intuitively, Dr. Cynthia has known that she would serve this calling since the age of five, after accompanying her physician mother to the medical clinic in their home country of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. There, she witnessed the pure hands-on art of healing, free from the modern-day challenges of drugs, bureaucracy, and the threat of malpractice.This experience laid dormant deep within her as she navigated her American life, completed her modern medical training at Harvard Medical School, and subsequently began practicing Western medicine. It wasnt until the opening of her own wellness center three years agowhere she guided her patients to experience tremendous improvement in their health and well-being through integrative lifestyle practices that focused on nutrition, fitness, and spiritual or meditative practicesthat those early childhood memories of the art of self-directed healing were reawakened.Rediscovering her life purpose has inserted authenticity to her work and filled her with joy, energy and spirit. She believes the mind-body connection for health is best served through the practice of being centered and present in each moment. A practicing Buddhist, Dr. Cynthia is on a mission to deliver that message, best outlined in her new book, Your Vibrant Heart: Restoring Health, Strength & Spirit from the Bodys Core.As one of the best holistic doctors in Burbank CA, Dr. Cynthia manages two successful cardiology clinics and is the founder of Revitalize-U, a wellness center focused on health, nutrition, weight loss, and detoxification. Beyond her academic and professional achievements, she is most proud of the praises that she receives from her patients who describe her style of practice as caring, compassionate, service, and excellence oriented.Education:University of Chicago, Pritzker School of MedicineHarvard Medical Schools training programsBeth Israel HospitalMassachusetts General HospitalBrigham & Womens hospitalAwards & Honors:2005 LA Business Journal Women Making a Difference Nomination1997 National Research Service Award NIH1995 Cardiovascular Research Award, American College of Cardiology1994 Raymond Kalil Memorial Cardiovascular Research Award1993 Kathleen Swan Ginsberg Award1993 Elected Chief Resident, Internal Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital1990 Alpha Omega Alpha, University of Chicago1986 Summa Cum Laude, University Of Illinois1982 Bronze Tablet AwardProfessional Appointments:1997 Assistant Clinical Professor Medicine UCLA School of Medicine1990 Clinical Fellow of Medicine, Harvard Medical School1986 Teaching Assistant, Dept. of Medicine, University of Chicago1982 Teaching Assistant, Dept. of Chemistry, University of Illinois2003 Co-director of the Womens Cardiac Risk Screening Program at Providence Saint Joseph Medical CenterPublications:2016  Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Practical Cardiology: Evaluation and Management of Common Cardiovascular Disease2014  Your Vibrant Heart: Restoring Health, Strength & Spirit from the Bodys Core1999  Coronary Artery Disease  Principles of Womens Health1998  Nitric Oxide, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, and cyclic GMP Inhibit the Growth-promoting Effects of Norepinephrine in Cardiac Myocytes and Fibroblasts  Journal of Clinical Investigations1997  Hemorrhagic Complications of Thrombolytic and Anticoagulant Therapy  Textbook of Coronary Thrombosis.1995  Pressure- and Volume-Induced Left Ventricular Hypertrophies As Associated With Distinct Myocyte Phenotypes and Differential Induction of Peptide Growth Factor mRNAs  Circulation1995  Molecular and Cellular Events in Myocardial Hypertrophy and Failure  Heart Failure: Cardiac Function and Dysfunction, Volume VI.

Customized Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy plans are available, and Doctor di Lorenzo of Camden OBGYN in Saint Marys, Georgia has helped many patients to regain balance and vitality with her expert treatment plans.Thousands of women that come into Doctor di Lorenzos practice are suffering from the effects of reduced hormone levels that accompany perimenopause and menopause. Many women experiencing hormone decline often have symptoms that include fatigue, low libido, weight gain, thinning hair, anxiety, depression, thinning bones, or vaginal dryness. Correcting imbalances can help women to regain their quality of life and sense of wellbeing. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy offers women a natural solution to hormone decline. Bioidentical hormones are identical in chemical structure and function to the hormones produced in the human body, which can allow them to be easily used with few to no side effects.While women most commonly experience symptoms of hormone decline, men also can experience changes with dropping hormone levels. Some of the symptoms that men can encounter include muscle atrophy, fatigue, hair loss, poor workout performances, anxiety, erectile dysfunction, and low libido. Replenishing deficient hormones can allow men to recover from imbalances and improve overall levels of health and wellness.","","","3a82021b4cc74618","951","528","12\/6\/14","0","0","0","eva_dilorenzo@yahoo.com"

She received this residency training at the busiest county hospital and children's hospital in North Texas. She remains steadfast in her belief in all the osteopathic tenets and she utilizes this philosophy in treating her patients. She practices the osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT) that she learned in medical school to promote the health and healing of her patients.

After a thorough education including a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from the University of Florida in 2010, a Masters in Nursing in 2006, and years of working in a healthcare system that revolves around insurance starting with home health care as a graduate from the respiratory care program at Santa Fe Community College in 1995, Lisa knew there had to be a better way. Her years in a primary care where the expectation was to see each patient for less than 15 minutes pushed Lisa to seek out a new model for health care, a model that put the patient at the center not billing codes and government requirements. Opening a practice was a dream. But that dream was always at the mercy of rapidly changing insurance laws and heavy burdens placed on health care providers by insurance companies. Late in 2014, after reading an article about direct primary care everything changed as new options came into focus. Options like earning a living and getting to spend a lot of time with patients while making a lasting positive impact on their health. The direct primary care model allows just that.

My love in nursing led me to specialize in womens health.  Reminding women to take care of themselves is my passion.  Over the years I have gained great knowledge and as a woman I have been able to put much of this knowledge into practice on myself, being both student and patient.  You see I am also an educator.  I believe that knowledge is power, but it must be shared.  My latest endeavor is getting my masters degree.  We should never stop learning.  As I reflect on the path I have been on and now the path that lies ahead, I hope to share all that I can with you.  As both a working wife and mother I know first hand that we as women often times put ourselves last.  It has become my mission in life to offer the very best medical care, in particular when it comes to womens overall health and well-being.

Doctors should be directly approachable & responsive (instead of through an answering service), an advocate for you in other environments (in the hospital, E.R., and with other specialists), and a trusted advisor who is accountable to you, knows you by name and cares about protecting your most important asset, your health. A practice should have transparent pricing with no surprises, and be free of government and insurance dictates that oftentimes do not have the best interest of the patient in mind.Dr. John was born and raised in Texas, coming from a family of 12. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from Texas A&M University, completed medical school at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston, and is board certified in Family Medicine. He joined MyMDbcs in July 2014 and is excited about providing care at a practice that makes possible many of the health care principles he is passionate about.","","","5d7b7b76090da1aa","966","540","12\/6\/14","0","1","1","dr.john@mymdbcs.com;nicole@mymdbcs.com"

He was raised in New Iberia and obtained a degree in Biology from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and his MD from Louisiana State University School of Medicine in Shreveport. He completed his Internship and Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile where he served as chief resident. He is a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.Dr. Fuller lives in Lafayette with his wife Sarah. They have two grown sons, Ryan and Ben. They enjoy short getaways including camping and hiking in state parks and attending LSU games.As a gynecologist, he specializes in evaluating and treating hormonal imbalances, including perimenopausal issues, with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. For many years he has performed hormone pellet procedures with outstanding results for his patients. A woman has many complex medical issues throughout her entire adult life. From puberty to pregnancy to the perimenopausal and menopausal years, it helps to have an OB\/GYN  physician to partner with each patient during every stage of her life.Along with hormonal imbalances, women have many other associated issues including infertility, abnormal bleeding, reproductive problems, and pain. Dr. Fuller has extensive experience as a womens health care specialist. His professional interests include care of routine and high risk OB patients and minimally invasive GYN surgery, including being certified to perform da Vinci robotic cases.  Another special interest includes treating heavy vaginal bleeding with outpatient hysteroscopy and NovaSure ablation of the uterine lining. Dr. Fuller finds it rewarding to be able to offer help for all of these concerns.One thing Dr. Fuller knows after taking care of women for over thirty years, is that each womans individual needs must be handled with individualized care. Being a certified bioTE provider, he feels he can offer the best possible plan to evaluate and treat all of the aspects that cause a womans hormone imbalance. Dr. Fuller also offers bioidentical hormonal testosterone pellet therapy for men. Many men discover how much better their partner feel after her hormones are optimized and want to feel better also. Many men wonder why they waited so long to get tested after seeing how much better their lives have become. I am truly honored to have been part of the lives of many women in Acadiana, from the thrill of delivering healthy children, to the heartbreak of infertility and pregnancy losses and cancer.  One of the most gratifying experiences I've had is taking care of three generations of women in the same family. I have also had the amazing experience of delivering babies of mothers and fathers that I delivered.Compassion, trust, and calmness are virtues I strive for each day, and I feel my years of experience can better help me to care for the variety of medical issues affecting our patients.Please visit our website www.georgefullermd.com to learn more about our practice.","gfullermd@hamilton-medical-group.com","337-981-6100","46236ac3c275214f","3438","1807","9\/16\/17","0","1","1","sargeoful@hotmail.com"
