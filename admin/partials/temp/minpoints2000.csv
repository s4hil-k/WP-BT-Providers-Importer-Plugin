He did his undergraduate study, medical school and Family Practice Residency at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He and his family moved back to Wylie in 1985 after becoming board certified in Family Practice. He joined his father, Terrill M Trimble, MDs practice and they worked together until 1998.  He then joined the Family Medical Center of Tulsa medical staff and was an attending physician with the In His Image Family Practice Residency out of Hillcrest Medical Center for the next four years. He and his family returned to East Texas in 2002, moving to Pittsburg, Texas to work with East Texas Medical Center. In 2007 he gave up his clinic practice and became a full time hospitalist with the ETMC Pittsburg Critical Access Hospital. March, 2012, he joined the medical staff at the Linden Good Shepherd Medical Center (GSMC) and resumed a full Family Practice with Good Shepherd Medical Associates (GSMA), caring for both clinic and hospitalized patients. PhyNet, a non-profit healthcare corporation took over management of the Linden GSMA clinic when GSMA closed the Linden hospital.Dr. Trimble has enjoyed being a part of PhyNets network of primary care clinics that are committed to providing advanced medical technology in coordinated services, focusing on personal care, patients total wellness, with quicker and easier access in underserved neighborhoods.He became interested in functional medicine in 2012 after realizing the failure of current medical care: typically a doctor moving from patient to patient writing multiple prescriptions, a pill for every ill and a drug for every bug, with the goal of seeing as many patients as possible.In general, medical doctors diagnose and manage disease; where functional medicine seeks to addresses the underlying causes of disease, engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. Dr. Trimble is working to shift the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach. He would like to recapture the essence of being a doctor, which originates from the Latin verb doc?re 'to teach'. Training and certification in BioTE has been refreshing for Dr. Trimbles practice of medicine. He is realizing his desire to practice functional medicine. He now can assist his patients to create health by providing care that restores the necessary components needed by the body to age in health. It is his desire for people to stay healthy and active for the rest of their life.","","","241ee3ebc4d1ccad","741","413","8\/15\/14","0","0","1","jdgale@sbcglobal.net"

In 1992 he completed his internship and residency at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver, Colorado.  His private practice career started in this very office with his first partner Dr. David Ricca until Dr. Ricca's untimely death in 1996. Dr. Bruce Dorr then joined him in 1997. That spirit of partnership continues to thrive today, not only between Dr. Watson and the office staff, but with his patients as well. Many patients actively share in their care as a result. Dr. Watson certified in performing robotic surgery with the DaVinci method.Dr. Watson was married in 1988 and now has two boys, JJ and Jake. His family is the most important aspect of his life and he considers his office staff as part of that family (for which we are all grateful!)

Dr. Watson is an avid bicyclist and skier and he has formally logged over one million vertical feet of heli-skiing!  Welcome!Personal message from Dr. WatsonI have been an OB\/GYN for over twenty-five years and have promoted healthy lifestyles with diet and exercise as part of my practice. My mantra has always been Its not what you could do, its not what you can do, but what you will do when you are 90.  However, I found that something was missing, that eating well and activity were not enough. We have struggled with traditional forms of hormone treatments and doing what we were told, but this wasnt working either. It was through a series of these frustrations that I happened upon BioTE Medical. I am excited to be finally able to offer something to my patients (and their husbands!) that can bring back that spark in life. I have promoted bioidenticals for a long time, but the delivery mechanisms and often the products were substandard.  I feel we now have both issues addressed so we can achieve that Right Balance.","","","a47394966b4983fd","598","256","11\/9\/13","2","1","1","mvesaw@lobga.net; mhawkins@lobga.net"

He continued his education at Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences and graduated in 1975 with his medical degree in Osteopathic Medicine.Merle decided at a young age to become a doctor  though it was through tragic circumstances. While in the second grade, he discovered a young mother next door, who lived in his same neighborhood, had taken her own life. The thought entered his mind, If I had known what to do I could have saved her. Through this neighborhood tragedy, Merle Turner was determined to one day become Dr. Turner so that he could help people through the various stages of mental and physical health.For Dr. Turner, patient care takes many forms, however, he is particularly passionate about the practice of preventative care. Though his passion for preventative care is all-encompassing, he sums it up with the simple philosophy of, Preventing a problem is better than trying to cure a problem.","mturner@warnerfamilypractice.net","480-752-7600","5d0d286ebe5127cd","2310","1227","10\/15\/16","0","1","1","jnewell@warnerfamilypractice.net"

Although it may seem like she was a city girl, Dr. McConnell grew up on a farm. In fact, her medical experience began on her familys farm with the medical care of her animals.I passed out cold the first time I saw my Dad give our cat vaccinations.This experience allowed Dr. McConnell to realize that she wanted to help people. It was as a teenager that she got interested in science and worked as a veterinary technician. The fascination of science, nature and the human body and how perfectly orchestrated it all is was the reason she chose the medical field.Practicing medicine has many rewards as Dr. McConnell will tell you.Making the patient feel better when they are certain they wont. Giving back a quality life so they can follow their bliss, which is the purpose of our lives.Dr. McConnell, just like the rest of the Warner Family Practice staff, knows the importance of preventative care. When you put an emphasis on preventative care, it offers a longer, higher quality life and empowers a person to pursue what matters in their life.For Dr. McConnell, practicing medicine is more than her job, its about improving and fostering human connections. Deeper human connections teach us about life, love and ourselves.My goal is honest, genuine connections with people everyday.When you build these relationships with the patient, you are able to speak truthfully about all your past health choices, no matter what they are. Dr. McConnell will tell all her patients, that was you then, you are not that person now. The past is a lesson to learn and improve on. Its knowledge just like anything else. Focusing on the future and not your past is when you move forward.Outside the office, making time for herself is Dr. McConnells top priority. That one aspect is different from day-to-day.","drmcconnellnd@gmail.com","480-752-7600","bdc34fef077f66ee","3476","1227","10\/15\/16","0","1","1","jnewell@warnerfamilypractice.net"

Growing up, Paul would spend time with his father, a physician, making rounds at the hospital. It was during this time that he first displayed an interest in working in medicine. In 1999, Paul went on to earn his Bachelor of Medical Science from Midwestern University.As a child and even into adulthood, Pauls parents stressed and impressed upon him the need to be helpful to other people. Both of his parents were in healthcare and, to Paul, entering the same field seemed to be the best way to serve others. In 2004, Paul followed in the footsteps of his parents and earned his Master of Science from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine.Medicine has been so rewarding because Ive been able to see patients utilize health screenings and preventative medicine to improve their overall health and well-being.Because he realizes the benefits of treating patients with a preventative medicine mind set, Paul looks for the most medically appropriate and patient-centric preventative methods to help them prevent potential conditions or delay conditions which may be inevitable. Ultimately its about helping patients be at their best, day in and day out.Success is seeing patients feel better physically. Success is witnessing the changes they make in their lifestyles to improve their health.When patients visit with Paul, he knows each one comes from a unique health background, having made a variety of good or bad health choices. No matter the consequences of those choices, he sees now as the best possible time to start making new life decisions for the benefit of the patients health.Paul lives in Gilbert with his wife, Beth.

One thing that has become apparent is that pain programs that rely primarily on conventional pharmaceutical medications are limited. For this reason Dr. Robinson began to search for treatment alternatives that would expand his comprehensive approach and improve clinical outcomes. This approach focuses on optimizing the bodys natural functional and restorative capacity via the tenants of nutrition, hormone optimization, and wellness.In pursuit of the most heavily researched and vetted approaches, he became a Certified Fellow and Board Certified by the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine. These concepts have served as his inspiration as medical director of Longevity Health, Beauty, and Wellness. In 2012 Dr. Robinson was also selected into the inaugural class of Pink Tie Guys by the Susan G.

Mrs. Newman began her career practicing part-time in a thriving weight loss clinic alongside Dr. Richard Welch.

I had mainly worked in specialty areas i.e. newborn ICU, operating room, recovery room, emergency room. My thesis was on exploring hormonal changes during menopause. Sexual Dysfunction and Management Issues in the Aging Woman. I have been interested in hormones and their function in the body for many years. I feel this is an area lacking in the medical field. I feel the medical community at large know very little about the thyroid gland and the brain. These two amazing organs are so complex and drive many or all of the functions in the human body. The information given me in NP school about the thyroid gland and how to manage it was so elementary.  I have since taken the initiative to study and learn all I can about the thyroid and sex hormones so I can help my patients have a higher quality of life. I have seen bio-identical hormones make a huge difference in how my patients feel and embrace life. Improving the quality of life in my patients is so enriching to me. Improving the quality of my own life with bio-identical hormone has been such a positive journey.Preventative health makes so much more sense than fixing whats broken.

She is board-certified in anesthesia.   In addition to managing patients in the intensive care unit, she has also taken care of patients in her pain management clinic and in her preoperative clinic. This experience has made her realize that many of the very seriously ill people that she cared for would not have been in that situation if they had made different choices in their lives.Over 20 years ago during a lecture at an anesthesia meeting she was introduced to the concept of preventive aging. The speaker presented peer-reviewed studies that demonstrated slowing of the aging process and even some reversal by doing certain things. Since that time she has practiced his recommendations and continued to follow the literature and change her behavior accordingly. During these last 20+ years, this information has become more mainstream and people are out there searching for the secret to living longer and living better. In spite of this, the general health of the population has become significantly worse and for the first time in recorded history the next generation may live for a shorter period of time than the previous generation. About 2 1\/2 years ago she was given the opportunity to start practicing a form of medicine to help people understand their individual risk factors for disease and guide them through a plan to prevent these diseases from affecting their future.Recently she has opened a new office focusing on mens health, and of course, bio-identical hormone replacement therapy.","","","b62dfff81591cb93","267","607","3\/10\/15","0","1","1","bbowers@gmail.com"

After passing my boards to practice medicine in the United States, I completed my Residency training in family practice at The McAllen Family Practice Residency Program which is affiliated with UT Health Science Center at San Antonio.  Family Practice & Obstetrics is my passion and the residency program I completed provided excellent training in these two areas. I have been in practice now for aprox 13 years with my best friend as my partner and I wouldn't change a thing. I have been truly blessed to be able to do what I love surrounded by people who I care about and who share my same values. During the early part of my formation I started to develop an interest in Aesthetics and have had the privilege of opening a Medspa and dedicating some of my time to grow in this area as well. Recently my focus has been preventative medicine and focusing on helping my patients live healthier and happier lives. I was recently appointed as chairperson for the Preventative Medicine Committee at one of our local hospitals. Over the years I have seen the main aspects of life which influence our culture and our people and lead them to develop chronic illnesses. . I am currently studying to be a health coach since I would like to dedicate more time to helping people reach their goals in weight loss but most important help them live a more balanced life. I am very interested in hormone testing and natural hormone replacement with bio identical hormones through pellet therapy.I commit to continue my endeavor of preventing illness through education, change in lifestyle, optimizing patients hormones and most important being there as support to my patients.

They had loss of memory and difficulty thinking at times.  They displayed irritability, anxiety, and depression-like symptoms.  They were having decreased loss of muscle strength with joint pain.  Along with these symptoms, they lacked sexual desire and performance.  I knew their hormones were to blame but the medicines offered by the conventional medical community had potential side effects or even caused heart attacks, stroke, DVTs and cancer and I didnt really see them as effective.I searched for a long time to find the right solution that would be safe for my patients, be effective and reverse all the symptoms they were experiencing.  I found it in Bioidentical Hormone Therapy or BHRT for short.  These hormones, along with some supplements, allowed my patients to regain energy and muscle strength while feeling younger and happier.  They had increased mental clarity and ability to lose weight again.  It restored or increased their sex drive and performance while decreasing their joint and muscle pain.  Its been a great experience and we are just starting out.  I can not wait to see what else happens.Call to speak to a representative and see if Balanced Hormone therapy is Right for you.","rlingreen@cwpain.com","502-352-2530","f3d055628c1313c3","3284","1735","7\/15\/17","0","1","1","rlingreen@cwpain.com;lhogan@cwpain.com"

Drost, MD, ND, FACS first realized his calling as a physician at the age of eleven before entering junior high. He was very taken by the lives and practices of several family physicians in the small town where he grew up in southern Nevada and was encouraged by his parents to pursue the medical profession. He attended the University of Wyoming on a varsity football scholarship, earning a BS in Zoology\/Physiology (premed). He then attended and graduated from the University of Nevada, School of Medicine in 1985 and completed a general surgery residency and trauma fellowship at the University of South Florida in 1991.Dr. Tom served four years as a surgeon for the U. S. Army as a Major where he served both abroad and, in the U.S., During this time he experienced the ins and outs of a public health system, based upon the model of disease prevention used to maintain the health of the troops and their families. He then entered the world of a private surgical practice in Las Vegas, Nevada. It took only four short and painful years for him to come to the conclusion that medicine, and the way it was being delivered, was not the same as it was during his boyhood years. He feels the overall health of our society is deteriorating into chronic illness, patient and physician satisfaction are at an all-time low, and many previously successful therapies for many illnesses are no longer working or effective. Dr. Tom decided he would find a better way to deliver health care or quit!Dr. Tom left a successful surgical practice in Las Vegas to enroll at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washington, one of five accredited naturopathic universities in North America. While practicing general surgery with a Seattle group, he earned a post graduate degree in Naturopathic Medicine. Dr. Tom Drost is currently a licensed physician and board-certified surgeon in the state of Illinois practicing environmental medicine, mens health, IV therapies and specializing in chronic conditions. His goal is to optimize and bring clients' health back into focus and helping them to live and experience a better quality of life. His practice of environmental medicine includes cleansing\/detoxification, allergy elimination, and treating toxic exposures. He completed additional training in environmental medicine under one of the nation's leading experts, Dr. Walter Crinnion. Dr. Tom combines the principles of conventional medicine with naturopathic principles, using such modalities as botanical medicine, IV nutrition and chelation, nutritional supplementation and lifestyle modification. Dr. Tom has expanded his interest in mens health by implementing a comprehensive mens health program. Dr. Tom is a respected physician in his community and maintains open and cooperative relationships with other physicians and health professionals of all disciplines.In his spare time, he enjoys travel, sports, exercise, spending time with his daughter and his dogs, working in the garden, and the hobby of collecting Lionel toy trains.","tdrost59@gmail.com","630-871-8100","0672c9051ac6220a","3835","1960","1\/13\/18","0","1","1","lisadrost9@gmail.com"

After residency, he worked in emergency medicine for 15 years. He became board certified in emergency medicine in 1997. Despite working in a variety of emergency department settings, he did not find the work fulfilling because he felt that there had to be more than a band aid approach to helping people fight disease. What Dr. Portales found in practice was that conventional medicine is disease oriented but fails to address the underlying issues of the individual. He also found that a patients lifestyle and nutrition were seldom if ever addressed. In the acute care setting, this approach saves lives. However, in the chronic care setting, this approach fails miserably. Chronic disease represents 78% of the total healthcare expenditures in the U.S and despite the billions spent, people are not any healthier.Dr. Portales has since sought out other methods to deliver quality healthcare to patients where the root causes are addressed. What he learned through many hours of study is that diseases are multi-factorial and healthcare must be approached with an open mind. This means integrating other methods of healthcare delivery with an ultimate goal of optimizing a patients health. He found that each patient represents a unique set of circumstances and this necessitates an individualized approach to each and every patient.Dr. Portales approach involves complete hormonal evaluations including testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. He also assesses thyroid function and adrenal function. Other issues assessed include nutritional status, overall toxic load, emotional stressors, and gut function.Dr. Portales is Board Certified by the American Academy of Anti-aging Medicine in Anti-Aging, Regenerative, and Functional Medicine. He completed his Fellowship training in Anti-aging, Regenerative, and Functional Medicine in 2011 (FAARM). He continues to pursue a Masters in Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine at the University Of South Florida College Of Medicine.Last  year, Dr. Arturo Portales also won the www.vitals.com Patients Choice Award and the Compassionate Doctor Recognition award .","dr.portales@ocmedicaltustin.com","714-442-6642","ee3a47533b641c4d","2340","1249","10\/15\/16","0","1","1","erin.lakes@ocmedicaltustin.com"

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology\/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the bodys inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients, and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.","pa@west2northsd.com","951-302-2000","bce3db3a20780832","2535","1694","6\/15\/17","0","0","0","aa@olympusmovement.com"

My interests have been in womens health care and preventative medicine since becoming a licensed physician in 1992. After obtaining my medical degree from the University of Health Sciences, Kansas City, I completed the family medicine residency at Truman Medical Center in 1995, also in Kansas City. I have two daughters. Kristin lives in Denver and is studying to be a radiology technician, and Jennifer lives in California with her children Jack & Ella. If you ask me about my grandchildren you will get an earful!After years of prescribing pills for fatigue, depression, insomnia, muscle aches and pains, night sweats, low libido, low energy and lack of mental focus I was excited to learn of a very successful alternative approach with BioTE. As we age, the natural hormones we have decline and we begin to predictably suffer from the results of this. After becoming certified in the BioTE Method of hormone replacement, I am now offering this therapy to my patients. The pellet method of hormone replacement has been used and studied for many decades and is a safe and effective treatment option for both women and men. The science and experience behind the BioTE Method offers a better quality of life for all who suffer from the above mentioned symptoms. I would be happy to discuss this with you to see if you would be a good candidate for this treatment option. A simple questionnaire and blood test is all that is needed to see if you would benefit from this therapy. I hope to see you soon!","","","39ababd133b2c876","1203","666","5\/9\/15","0","1","1","dpurdy@pinnaclemedicalpartners.com"

His extensive research on the basic science of cell biology and scarless wound healing won him numerous awards, including one from the American College of Surgeons and another from the Association for Academic Surgery. His graduation thesis was published in the prestigious medical journal, Shock. In addition to his basic science research, he completed a Clinical Trauma Fellowship at New Jersey Medical School under the supervision of Dr. John H. Siegel, a pioneer in Trauma Surgery in the United States.Subsequently, he started his General Surgery training at New York Methodist Hospital, where he also served as a chief resident. During his General Surgery residency, his interest in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery grew. His creativity and surgical skills were recognized by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), and he was invited to present a novel aesthetic breast surgery procedure he invented at that societys annual meeting when he was a third-year General Surgical resident. His contributions to Cosmetic Surgery were also recognized by the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and his paper received the Best Resident Paper of the Year award.Upon completion of his General Surgery training, Dr. Ceydeli started his Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery residency at the Medical College of Georgia. He contributed numerous articles to the Plastic Surgery literature, continued to present his innovative techniques at national meetings, and continued to receive accolades during his Plastic Surgery training.Dr. Ceydeli was selected by Consumers Research Council of America for inclusion in the 2007 Guide to Americas Top Plastic Surgeons and has been honored in multiple editions of Whos Who in America, which named him one of the emerging leaders in Healthcare and Medicine. He is one of only a handful of plastic surgeons in Northwest Florida to be double board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Surgery.After finishing his Plastic Surgery training, Dr. Ceydeli also completed a prestigious Aesthetic Fellowship in Honolulu, Hawaii with the legendary Dr. Robert Flowers. Dr. Ceydeli is one of the few Plastic Surgeons in the country to be accepted to this program. His fellowship in Hawaii mainly focused on Facial Aesthetic Surgery and Asian Plastic Surgery.After completing this fellowship, Dr. Ceydeli settled in Panama City Beach, on Floridas Emerald Coast. His double board certification in plastic surgery and his advanced cosmetic surgery training with Dr. Flowers have made him uniquely qualified to pioneer numerous innovative procedures, both invasive and non-invasive, since his move to Northwest Florida.Working in concert with his mentor Dr. Flowers, Dr. Ceydeli invented the revolutionary MAG-5 facial rejuvenation procedure, a breakthrough that changed the concept of aesthetic facial surgery the world over. They co-authored the landmark article about MAG-5 in the prestigious plastic surgery journal, Clinics in Plastic Surgery. They presented and taught this innovative technique at numerous national and international scientific meetings. Plastic surgeons from every corner of the globe flew in to watch and learn this technique.When facial structures start migrating southward due to the effects of gravity and aging, the MAG-5 procedure relocates them to the north, for the most natural and long lasting results. This is in contrast to most other facial procedures, such as the facelift, which pulls the face to the east and west, instead of lifting it northward where it belongs. The term facelift is actually a misnomer. Since the incisions made for this procedure are next to the ears, the facelift technique can only pull the face towards to ears, which in most cases gives the face an unnatural, tight look and does not address aging-related changes around the eyes and brows, or the cheek tissue itself. MAG-5, on the other hand, lifts the eyebrows, rejuvenates the lower eyelids by restoring its youthful almond shape, and lifts all the cheek tissue (not the skin alone), returning it to its original location. And, unlike those of a facelift, the MAG-5 incisions are invisible. There are only two incisions, one on the hair-bearing scalp, and another tiny incision under the eyelid. There are no incisions and thus no scars in front of the ear. This novel MAG-5 concept provides natural and longer lasting results.One of the other innovative techniques Dr. Ceydeli learned from his work with Dr. Flowers is Valentine Mouth Rejuvenation. Again, due to the effects of gravity and aging, the corners of the mouth turn downward, giving the face a sad, frowning look. Many physicians think that this problem can be corrected by injecting soft tissue fillers or doing fat transfers. However, without addressing the down-turned mouth corners, injections alone only make matters worse. Patients often end up with the swollen sausage lips and lack of lip definition we have become all too familiar with. Dr. Ceydeli addresses the aging mouth by lifting the corners of the lips with a heart-shaped design flap (a small office procedure performed under local anesthesia), which gives the face a happy, pleasant look. He uses soft tissue fillers not to enlarge the lips, but to redefine them. His advanced chemical peel technique and\/or state-of-the-art laser treatment further eliminates wrinkles around the lips and improves skin texture around the mouth area. The entire procedure is performed in the office under local anesthesia and takes less than an hour, giving the lips and mouth region an instant aesthetic improvement with natural results. No unnaturally inflated sausage lips  guaranteed.Dr. Ceydeli is the only plastic surgeon in the region performing liposuction-assisted short-scar breast lifts and reductions. Although he has made improvements to traditional breast lift\/reduction techniques (inferior pedicle Wise-pattern breast lift\/reduction) and published articles on the subject, he now exclusively uses the liposuction-assisted short scar-breast lift\/reduction technique for all breast lift and reduction cases, no matter how big or sagging the breast. With this technique, he minimizes unsightly scars beneath the breast, and more importantly, sculpts a beautiful, round, uplifted breast with longer lasting results than traditional breast lift\/reduction techniques.Dr. Ceydelis tummy tucks (abdominoplasties) are also different from the rest. They are not simply removing excess skin and fat, but rather toning and sculpting the abdomen with a sexy waistline, creating a natural innie belly button, and placing the incisions low enough that scars are invisible even with the lowest-cut bikini bottom.In addition to his innovative and unique approaches to face, breast, and body, Dr. Ceydeli established the first advanced follicular unit hair transplantation center in the region, resulting in numerous happy patients. The newest techniques in hair transplant require a team approach, and Dr. Ceydelis hair transplant center is staffed with some of the best Bosley-trained hair technicians in the country with many years of experience.Despite his advanced surgical training and background, Dr. Ceydeli has pioneered some of the most advanced non-invasive skin rejuvenation techniques in Floridas Panhandle. He adapted the True Blood skin rejuvenation technique to his practice. This technique uses the patients own blood to rejuvenate the skin. Platelet-rich plasma, or PRP rich in growth factors and stem cell markers is obtained from the patients blood and reinjected back under the skin, thus stimulating skin cells to repair and refresh themselves. Since the persons own blood is used, this is an absolutely safe approach, and the device used to obtain the PRP is FDA-approved. Even though this innovative technique is popular in Europe and has been featured in the US media, Dr. Ceydeli is still the only physician in Northwest Florida and one of the very few in the entire state to offer this procedure. Dr. Ceydeli also has Northwest Floridas most advanced Lumenis skin resurfacing laser. This unique fractional CO2 laser, unlike the Fraxel laser, has the advanced technology to treat deep acne and surgical scars by stimulating new collagen formation, along with its standard use for wrinkles and brown age spots on the skin.These innovative procedures and techniques are only few of the many services offered here at Plastic Surgery Institute & Spa.
