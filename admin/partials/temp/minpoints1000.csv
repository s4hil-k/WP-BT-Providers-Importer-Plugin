In fact, she has a family Christmas card with a picture of her at 2 years old wearing a nursing uniform! Although she had no idea when that idea took root, she distinctly remembers when she decided on a particular focus: in her Nursing Roles class when she opened the gray textbook and read the description of a Nurse Practitioner. At that moment, she knew that role would afford her the higher level of independence and decision-making she desired. Later, she discovered that as a Nurse Practitioner, she could forge a different path to take care of people in a way that aligned with her deepest valuesto treat patients as individual human beings, and not their diagnoses.As a nurse, Jody has participated in the traditional medical system, and as a patient, she has been its victim. While being treated for Crohns disease, traditional medicine made her sicker, and she developed lupus. None of her doctors could see outside the box. Fortunately, a friend took the time to listen and was determined to find another option when her doctors failed her.Continue ReadingFinish Line Dynamics is a world apart from that. As a Health Coach who is also a Nurse Practitioner, Jody has the opportunity to play it forward and care for people in the wayshe wants to be cared for. Here, an initial assessment is an hour long. She asks a lot of questions about nutrition, mental state, activity levels, and more, to really get to know herpatients and identify the source of the problem. The results are truly amazing! Jody describes a recent patient, a woman in her 40s, was suffering from chronic pain andfatigue. Nothing was workingnot physical therapy, not her chiropractor, not pain medication. Through blood work and genetic and micronutrient testing, Jody identified aVitamin deficiency and a metabolism problem. After three days on a supplement, the woman woke up pain free for the first time in twenty years! What a thrill to witness patients follow a treatment plan and get better! Jody says. Here at Finish Line, I can build sustaining relationships with patients that I never could while working in urgentcare.Jodys dream is to affect widespread community change beginning with individuals, usually mothers, and then families. Her doctoral dissertation focused on pediatric diabetes, which is a family-based disease. If we start with women and children, prevention can spread into the community, ending an epidemic. Mothers can institutegood nutrition and fitnessissues related to diabetes and obesityin their families, and families can change society.Getting and staying fit and healthy can be a fearsome thing, and Jody has faced down her own demons. In her early forties in Minnesota, she was struggling to overcome a weight problem and to get healthy. A friend who was officiating a triathlon invited her to check it out, but Jody was too paralyzed with fear even to go watch. She determined to overcome that fear and enter that triathlon the next year. The following summer, she completed three! The fitness bug had bit her, and she was losing weight, making friends, and slowly transforming herself.In 2012, Jody joined the Red Ribbon Ride to support the Minnesota AIDS Project, and completed a 300-mile course over four days. As she rode into the state capital, shedecided to join the California AIDS ride the following year, a seven-day, 545-mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles. By the time Jody did that ride in June 2013, she alsohad accepted an exciting new opportunity in nursing education in Orange County, California.The last five miles of that ride were exhilarating beyond belief. The realization of what she was doing hit hardHere I am in LA, and a week ago I was in San Francisco, and Iam on my bike! But not only thatthe memory of the emotional distance she had travelled spread out behind her as joyful tears flowed. So many people had doubted me,but look what I just did! I knew just how incredibly strong and capable I truly was.Jody believes anyone can and should revel in that wonderful, electrifying feelingto know that you are capable and enough. Finish Line Dynamics is groundbreaking in itscomprehensive, personal, and supportive approach that integrates mind and body.No matter your age, shape, or size, let Jody help you cross your own personal finish line and claim your optimal health.(Jody earned a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from Minnesota State University, Mankato, and has practiced in family medicine, pediatric intensive care, bone marrowtransplant, diabetes education, and urgent care settings. She also has taught nursing at the university level and served as an academic administrator. In addition to cycling andswimming, Jody enjoys movies, Disneyland, and baking. A native Minnesotan, she now finds great peace at the beach.)","drjody@finishlinedynamics.com","949-716-9464","2b6ca2dce634bf88","2086","1130","7\/16\/16","0","0","0","jodyjones2015@icloud.com "

I became board certified in family practice in 2006 and began looking into healthy aging in 2008.  My first discoveries were about adrenal dysfunction, low thyroid that is commonly missed by traditional Western medicine, and toxic metals.  Then about four years ago I found out about bio-identical hormones and was astounded at how they helped me, my wife and about 300 patients.  Up until three months ago, I had only heard about topical creams, and some oral meds.  Then I was exposed to pelleting through BioTE by Gunther Mueller!  Thank you!  I thought the topical was astounding, but I see that pellets have more science behind them and that they certainly work better.  I am more and more excited about the practice of medicine and my mission\/goal is to help aging people find help that will keep them active, strong, healthy and productive rather than being put out to pasture like so many elderly are in many countries.  When I see patients whose hormones are very low (many women have such low estrogen, progesterone and testosterone that the lab results show too low to be measured) and realize that they will likely live another 40 or 50 years with total deprivation of the hormones that kept them young, healthy, active, strong and happy, it really breaks my heart that modern medicine, for the most part, says be warmed and be filled and go your way and does absolutely nothing.  How can this be compassion when bio-identical hormones are so easily available?I saw a middle aged lady a few weeks ago for whom I had prescribed BHRT a year ago.  She told me that she went straight to her doctor and showed the prescription to him.  He said, Oh, no!  You cant take estrogen.  You will get addicted to it!  So, she obeyed him and didnt fill the prescription.  She returned feeling worse than last year and is more open to help.  I explained it all again but more about pellets, and she is scheduled for pellets soon!  So now I can say as I insert the pellets, Be warm and be filled, and really mean it and really do something worthwhile for people!","","","9f15192b4c725886","297","174","8\/10\/13","0","1","1","eagleswingmedical@yahoo.com"

Doctor Taylor feels that the patient is her best source of information and by listening to her patients and connecting with them through a one hour initial appointment, she can gain all the information needed to develop a customized treatment plan.Pasadena Bioidentical Hormones Doctor Julie Taylors passion is to help women and men live better, to feel whole, and to be at their best to keep up with all the juggling we do in our every day lives. With the chronic stress many people are under whether its fighting traffic, answering phone calls, dealing with home life stressors, not getting enough sleep and exercise, and even traveling on the plane frequently enough, our hormones can quickly become out of balance. Furthermore, we are exposed to a lot of toxins in our environment through the food we eat and air we breathe that can also wreak havoc on our hormonal balance. In addition, every time a woman has a baby, her hormones reset themselves, which could be balanced or unbalanced. When our hormones become disrupted, every part of our body is affected, from our quality of sleep, to our eating habits, our sex life, our propensity to disease, and the way we look and feel about ourselves. If your hormones are out of balance, getting them in balance can make you feel like a new you!Julie Taylor M.D. was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. She received her medical degree from Michigan State University and completed her MPH and residency training in preventive medicine at Loma Linda University, where she focused much of her training on bioidentical hormone replacement. She went on to complete additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy through the American Academy of Anti aging. She treats patients at her Sierra Madre, California clinic and focuses on preventive medicine, lifestyle medicine, chronic disease reversal,, and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. During the first visit, Doctor Taylor spends a full hour with each new patient, listening to their needs and health goals and develops a tailor-made plan based on each patients goals. Once each patient is well on his or her way to balanced hormones, Doctor Taylor conducts periodic tests to make sure this optimal balance is sustained.","","","","564","327","3\/22\/14","0","1","1","3babydocs@sbcglobal.net"

Her scope of practice encompasses health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and management of common and complex health care problems.Tiffany began her career in the health field as a certified dental assistant in 2007 in Cedar Hill, Texas.  There she became interested in pursuing a career in disease prevention and promotion as a nurse practitioner.  She graduated in 2013 with a BSN from Oklahoma Christian University and most recently acquired a MSN from South University of Georgia with a specialty in Family practice.  She eventually plans to obtain a Masters degree in Functional Medicine.  Her experience as a registered nurse has primarily been in the ICU and cardiac CCU where she earned a national certification in critical care (CCRN).  It was here that she learned the devastating effects the environment and lifestyle choices can have on the human body.  Frustrated by the healthcare climate today of treating patients in a health crisis versus prevention led her to seek other options to provide care that would seek eliminating the cause of the problem.  She found a solution in the Functional healthcare approach.  Functional practitioners examine each patients lifestyle and unique biochemical factors to identify the underlying causes of their disease and find treatments that help return patients to optimal health. This can only be done through a therapeutic relationship between patient and provider.  Hormone Replacement Therapy is a big part of making this possible.  It is at Encompass Wellness she wishes to pursue these practices with her patients.  Tiffany is originally from Edmond, Oklahoma where she currently resides with her husband Bennett and three children.  She attends Oakdale Church of Christ and believes in a Christ centered home.  She enjoys any craft that can provide a creative outlet, specifically sewing and spending time with friends and family.","trichey_1@yahoo.com","405-254-3000","c8487648933e3ebb","2478","521","11\/5\/14","0","1","1","jsokolosky@encompassedmond.com."

Being an orthopedic surgeon and having treated patients with fractures due to thin bones, he developed an interest in bio-identical hormone therapy as being a solution to help the body increase the strength of its bones.  Studies show that normal bone mass will increase while a person is being treated with bio-identical testosterone and estrogen.  Not only will they help the bones, but the bio-identical hormones protect the heart, brain, and breast.  Dr. Duchamp is excited about helping his patients to have a better and fuller life.","michael.duchamp@gmail.com","","a7e99fc15d843a10","93","334","4\/16\/14","2","1","1","jeffersnrader@gmail.com;barbara.rader@icloud.com"

He is board certified in Internal Medicine, Anti-Aging by A4M and and in multiple modalities of cosmetic medicine.Since 1981 he has been in the private practice of medicine. He has been an associate professor of medicine at USC. He was affiliated with the very reputable Scripps Clinic in San Diego California from 1993-1996. He now practices medicine in Satellite Beach, Florida at Florida Anti-Aging Center.During his years in practice, Dr. Adamcik has been actively involved in independent research for dietary treatment methods. He has reviewed thousands of books, journals and scientific articles in this field. He has been a contributor in medical research with particular experience in cholesterol studies. He has been a speaker for various pharmaceutical companies for his expertise in the area of diet and medication therapy for conditions like the hypertension, metabolic syndrome and cholesterol treatments. Dr Adamcik has had extensive training is the administration of Botox and advanced filler techniques using Juvederm and Restylane. He has also been trained in Advanced Laser Therapy.Dr. Adamcik regularly attends anti-aging, cosmetic, and bariatric (weight loss) conferences to remain the leader in innovative medical care.Dr. Adamcik's Anti-Aging StoryI was born a skinny kid. There are 3 basic body types you can inherit, ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorphic, meaning your body hereditarily is skinny, muscle and fat, I was born ectomorph or basically skin and bones. The kids used to joke if I turned sideways I would become invisible.Like most young adults, after I finished high school and all organized sports, my exercise evaporated, and I continued to eat an unhealthy high calorie diet full of cakes, cookies, ice cream, cereal, etc. The result was I became a fat skinny kid. I still had no muscle, but I was beginning to get a significant gut.By 1984, I could see the changes in the mirror and I adopted a rigorous exercise program. This included both aerobic exercise and vigorous weight training. My diet was still bad, but I was able to get rid of most of the fat and started to slowly build muscle. In 1987, brainwashed by the medical profession, I started a heart-healthy low fat diet. The translation of low fat essentially means high carbohydrate, as energy calories are predominately one or the other. As I continued the exercise, I built more muscle. But I was not able to lose fat and by 2000 I had put on a fair amount of weight in the middle again. My hormones were likely already declining by then as I was mid-40s and I was unaware of the issue, as was most of the medical profession at that time.In 2000, I had a sudden enlightenment and challenged the low fat diet mantra I had believed since medical school. I reviewed all of the dietary literature and studies that lead to that recommendation. I learned that the low fat diet was a fallacy based on wrongful interpretation of studies. There was significant data available to recommend a truly heart healthy diet. Hence I began work on my book The Globes Best Diet while I experimented on myself with various diets, and I monitored the results with frequent blood testing. The results where truly phenomenal and I lost most of my belly fat again. The diet was one that restricted carbohydrates and focused on healthy protein sources, vegetables, fruit and nuts.For the next 8 years, I worked vigorously on a low carb\/high protein diet along with both aerobic and weight training exercise program. My health was hitting new high highs, but I seemed to hit a wall when it came to further improvements.In 2008, I added a testosterone level to my routine blood test.  To my shock at the time, it was low.  Now in retrospect, it would have been obvious had I known what I know now.  I was already 55, a time when hormone decline is rampant.  And I was fatigued, had diminished drive and was still unable to shed middle weight in spite of incredible diet and exercise program.  My physician recommended hormone replacement therapy, and my body began to improve dramatically and quickly.  I was able to break through some of the wall that had appeared and improved my muscle mass while again shedding some middle weight.  At that time, I looked into anti-aging and decided against it as I thought it was hooey.In 2011, I had another life changing event. My energy levels declined drastically over a 4-month time period. All of my physicians were baffled and traditional blood testing was negative. My fatigue was so bad I resorted to napping on my lunch rather than work out and I would go to bed at 5 PM! When the alarm went off I would wake up exhausted. What could possibly be wrong? I wasnt depressed. By chance, I decided to attend a conference that included topics of weight loss, cosmetics, and anti-aging.I was amazed at the wealth of information available on anti-aging and I thought it would bring medicine to a whole new level. Of particular interest were the discussions on subtle hormone deficiencies of adrenal and thyroid glands which are very difficult to diagnose but cause symptoms similar to mine. Out of the blue, one of the doctors there came up to me and announced that my physical features where those of someone with severe adrenal problems and that I should start treatment immediately! I was quite excited to do these advanced tests on my return. I started adrenal treatment immediately as directed. I began to feel better rapidly as my energy levels improved. When the results returned, I was shocked to find out the stranger was right and my adrenals were wiped out! It was a diagnosis that could not have been made by conventional physicians. Even when I showed my primary doctor and an endocrinologist, they were still in disbelief. They were just not enlightened to anti-aging.Spurred by my dramatic improvement in energy and mental alertness, I delved into anti-aging further, and proceeded to more conferences and took the anti-aging certification test. I learned that everybody starts hormonal decline starting at age 20, So I started optimizing all of my hormones. The results were phenomenal. I am now in the best shape of my life approaching 60. Belly fat has evaporated, muscle mass has increased, energy levels are through the roof, sexual function is like a man in his 20s, and mental alertness is super. I am a total believer.This doesnt have to be just my story. I can make the same changes for you! Make an appointment to our state of the art anti-aging clinic and see the results yourself!","dradamcik@cfl.rr.com","321-690-0003","f201e6290e1dc892","893","1885","11\/2\/17","0","1","1","dradamcik@cfl.rr.com"

School of Medicine and completed her residency at Kosair Childrents Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky in 1994.  She has practiced primary care pediatrics in several communities in the greater Louisville area. She has balanced family with medicine throughout her career, which has been crucial in teaching her valuable lessons.Philosophically, Dr. White has always been a minimalist when it comes to medical care, believing that less is usually better.  She also believes that parents know their children and that knowledge empowers them to understand what is going on so that they can navigate their childrens health needs.  That frequently separated her from mainstream conventional medicine.  But armed with lots of stories from raising her own children, she continued to maintain that children are resilient and giving their bodies a chance to heal on their own trumped most medical interventions. It was her own health crisis that pushed her further into investigating options outside of conventional medicine.  She knew the treatments that conventional medicine had to offer and understood that they were only treating symptoms not addressing the underlying issues.  She ultimately came to a place of deep healing through changes in nutrition and supplementing with what her body needed not a bunch of prescription medications.  As she learned more, she knew that she wanted to be a part of teaching other people how to heal their bodies and encourage their spirits.  In early 2016 Dr White started formal fellowship training in functional medicine through the Metabolic Medicine Institute and the Institute for Functional Medicine.  Through this training, she has deepened her belief that our bodies are created to heal and that less medical intervention is usually more and that her role as a physician is to partner with her patients in the healing process.

DeAn ","Strobel","MD FACOG","EDUCATION: Bachelor's Degree of Mathematics and Spanish at Northeast Louisiana University, Monroe Louisiana, Graduate School in Engineering at Louisiana Tech University Ruston Louisiana, Medical School at Louisiana State University Medical Center Shreveport, Louisiana, Residency at Baylor University Medical Center Dallas, Texas.Dr. G. DeAn Strobel is a native of northeast Louisiana where she grew up on a farm on the Mississippi River delta. She attended Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe, LA where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and Spanish. She attended graduate school in engineering at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, LA but decided that biological sciences and medicine was where she truly belonged.Dr. Strobel then moved to Shreveport, LA where she attended Louisiana State University Medical Center. She had always liked surgery but also found a new interest in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Strobel enjoyed the combination of basic medicine, specialty studies, and surgery. She also enjoyed the knowledge that she would be able to follow her patients for many years and get to know them and their families well.After deciding to pursue a career in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology, Dr. Strobel moved to Dallas, TX to do her residency at Baylor University Medical Center. She completed her residency training in 1999.Just prior to completing her residency, she met her future husband Dr. Winston Marshall, an Interventional Cardiologist who was also in his last year of training. They married after a short courtship and moved to Sherman, TX where they began their respective practices.Dr. Strobel originally practiced both obstetrics and gynecology. She became pregnant with twins and was forced to stop practicing obstetrics when she developed some pregnancy complications. Thankfully, the pregnancy resulted in the birth of two wonderful and healthy baby boys in 2001. Dr. Strobel was forced to make a difficult decision. She decided to not return to practicing obstetrics in order to have a more \"normal\" and predictable home life for she and her sons.Because of her decision, Dr. Strobel has been able to focus her attention and energy into developing a clinic that is more attentive to the patient. She concentrates on treating the whole woman, not just the numbers. She has also developed a Medical Spa called Allure Laser and Medical Spa. There, she is able to treat more of the cosmetic concerns, which can sometimes lead to significant anguish or stress to the patient.Together Dr. Strobel and Lee Fisher are able to focus on caring for the female patient as a whole person and not just a diagnosis. At our clinic, we strive to make the patient feel like an individual. We are open and encourage communication. Come see the difference when it's \"Women Caring for Women\".","","","9bf37e1fdf67a752","106","91","11\/28\/12","2","1","1","dcosper@trlx.com;destrobel@trlx.com"

It was important to me that whatever I chose to do, it involved helping people and making individual lives better. Ob\/Gyn is the perfect platform for making a difference in the lives of women and families. I feel that I have the best job in the world  I am a one-woman welcoming committee for babies as they enter the world. And I am there for women as they age and become mothers and grandmothers.I enjoy the feeling that what I do makes a difference in peoples lives. I also feel that I am serving God through what I do. I hope that women can see that in me and know that they are nurtured and cared-for. I provide a clean, upscale environment so that patients can feel at home the moment that they walk into the facility. I also hope to give my patients information that empowers them to make good health decisions.My best quality as a practitioner is my ability to communicate and explain things in a down-to-earth way. Also, I am a skilled and experienced surgeon. I see my role as that of an educator. I outline the choices that the patients have and help them come to an educated decision about their health. I treat each person as I would want to have my sister or myself treated. I take joy in the success of others. I receive feedback every day from women who are grateful for the treatment that they are getting, and that provides nourishment for the soul and validation for my approach.In her spare time, Dr. Stewart loves dance and movement and taking salsa dance classes.

Laboratory testing used to diagnose hypothyroidism is inadequate, and current treatment for hypothyroidism is relatively ineffective. Groundbreaking research shows how persistent environmental toxins prevent thyroid and other hormones from working properly. Brief outline of benefits and training for proper treatment of hypothyroidism 1.A large majority of the populace has the illness.2.Low thyroid causes accelerated atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Proper treatment of hypothyroidism reduces the incidence of heart attacks incidence over 90% relative to the Framingham study.3.Diabetes incidence is greatly reduced. Those suffering DM have few complications due to avoidance of atherosclerosis.4.The majority of hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides) is avoided or resolves with treatment.5.The risk of developing hypertension is minimized. A majority of people with preexisting hypertension will normalize after proper treatment of hypothyroidism.6.Congestive heart failure is largely avoided. It is also reversed in most patients suffering with the problem.7.Arthritis is largely avoided and often reversed in those already suffering.8.A majority of menstrual problems and problems associated with pregnancies are avoided or reversed.9.Babies born are very robust if their mother is treated prior to becoming pregnant.10.The immune system is greatly enhanced.11.Obesity is greatly reduced, especially when combined with nutrition and exercise.12.Depression and mental illnesses are greatly reduced.c.)

Her career path includes earning several degrees in nursing, including a Master of Science Degree and Post Masters certificate as a Family Nurse Practitioner. While her clinical focus has shifted from Oncology\/Hematology to Family Practice, she continues to see a variety of patients ranging from new born to elderly in age, and has broadened her scope of practice to include bioidentical hormone therapy.  It has been a very positive experience to offer this hormone treatment option to men and women in my community. My personal experience of weight loss, improved energy and focus, is amazing. The feedback, returning clients, and new interest in this approach support the use of alternative therapy for those that seek a better way to manage hormone deficiencies.

Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery and laparoscopy have always been areas of interest, and these solutions have traditionally been under-utilized by providers who do not have this expertise. Most gynecologic surgeries can be performed with a minimally invasive procedure. This affords the patient minimal postoperative pain and rapid recovery time. Patients can return more quickly to productive, pain-free lives with little disruption in their daily routines and activities.My patients consider me warm, friendly and easily approachable. I take pride in listening carefully to my patients and pay close attention to their needs and concerns. I strive to be a compassionate provider. I never rush, and I always ensure that I dedicate sufficient time to address my patients issues and concerns to their satisfaction. I offer my patients my knowledge, technology, years of training and a willingness to go the extra mile to ensure that their needs and expectations are met. My goal is to make all the minimally invasive surgical options available to all my patients  for better outcomes and better patient experiences.

Never ignore a breast lump.  One in eight women will develop breast cancer. Of all the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer has the highest incidence and mortality worldwide.  However, it is the lowest in this country due to pap smears.  Receive them at the recommended time interval, and always follow up on an abnormal pap smear.

She is one of the few physicians in Hampton Roads who has completed the Institute for Functional Medicine's training program.  Functional Medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs.  By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach, Functional Medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional Medicine doctors spend time with their patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, Functional Medicine individualizes treating the patient.She is well-versed in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, menopausal issues, and the treatment of many chronic medical conditions with acupuncture and herbal medicine.Dr. Ryder is the mother of four boys, and enjoys reading, traveling, scrapbooking, yoga, and being a private pilot in her (limited) spare time.","rmryder@gmail.com","757-410-5462","696a457130b3a98a","2542","1957","12\/9\/17","0","1","1","gynspecialists@gmail.com"

Hormones are critical to our bodys health. They are the chemical messengers that tell other cells what to do. They regulate virtually every bodily function. Some of the expected results of balancing hormone levels through BHRT are: look and feel younger, decreased menopausal symptoms and joint pain: improved energy levels, mental clarity and mood: improved sleep quality, sexual function, metabolism and weight control.

In 2014, her commitment to the women in Van Zandt and Kaufman counties led her to begin a private practice in the area to serve her neighbors and friends.

She earned her BS in Nursing from Auburn University in Montgomery, her MS in Nursing from Troy State in Montgomery and her advanced Family Nurse Practitioner Certificate from the University of Alabama in Birmingham.  She and her family moved to Fort Collins in 2007 from Alabama.  She has an extensive background in Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Orthopedics and Dermatology.  Lisa was one of the first Nurse Practitioners to open her own independent Urgent Care and Medical Practice in Colorado following the revision in Colorado Law allowing qualified Nurse Practitioner to practice independent of a Physician.  She owns and operates The HealthCare Clinic of Fort Collins which opened in December of 2011.  She trained under both Dr. Donovitz and Dr. Tutera in 2012 when the company was still SottoPelle.  When the company divided she followed Dr. Donovitz as he founded BioTe Medical.  She is one of the longest practicing BioTe providers in Colorado.  A benefit of coming to a Medical Practice for your Bio-identical Hormone Therapy is the knowledge that if you have any other health questions, concerns or problems then they can be treated at the same location instead of being directed back to your primary care provider, additionally The HealthCare Clinic of Fort Collins is open 7 days a week, this means you can schedule your procedure on the weekend without having to take time from work to get in before the other clinic closes.  Her knowledge and hundreds of procedures along with being a patient herself some 6 years now gives her a unique perspective and understanding of what the patients want and will work tirelessly to achieve that balance with each person.  Outside the practice, she enjoys gardening, camping and travelling with her family.","","","d03d0b0a98c11aa3","15","15","11\/28\/12","0","1","1","lisamyers@healthcareclinic.org"

He graduated from medical school at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, Texas and completed a dually accredited AMA\/AOA residency in family medicine at Penn State affiliate program where he served as Chief Resident. He has since practiced family medicine in rural Kansas and rural Texas. Dr. Petersen is ready to bring his experience and expertise to the greater Salt Lake City area which includes a full scope of family medicine: providing office based care, making house calls, visiting his patients in the nursing home, caring for patients in the hospital, working in the local emergency room and delivering babies. Through this experience he as come to love caring for his patients through all stages of their lives, but he has also seen that there is a disconnect between how doctors practice medicine, and how people can become and stay healthy. He realized that standard therapies and approaches were failing to help many patients with complex conditions.While working as the Chief of Staff for Collingsworth General Hospital, Dr. Petersen realized that there is a desperate need to approach medical care differently.  He saw that too many patients were failing to see an improvement in their health, in spite of receiving typical and accepted therapies, provided by both primary care and specialist physicians.  He found this was especially true in the fields of endocrinology, infectious disease and womens health. Since that time, Dr. Petersen began to specialize in those areas that are poorly treated by physicians and specialists in the county, including hormonal imbalance, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, metabolic disorders, weight loss, bioidentical hormone replacement, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.  He is a fellow with the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine. In addition to providing cutting-edge medical care, Dr. Petersen enjoys hiking, biking, training for Spartan races, playing the guitar and singing.  Dr. Petersen speaks fluent Spanish and enjoys traveling and spending time with his wife and children.","","","0c320dc904427ebc","440","262","12\/7\/13","0","0","0","andrewpetersendo@gmail.com;"

Many understand the important concept of being physically fit but are you Hormone Fit? If not, he can help!Dr. Milligan founded Science Fit (www.sciencefit.net) as a natural extension of his desire to help individuals look, feel and function optimally throughout an entire lifetime. Practicing as a family physician after completing medical school and residency training at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, he witnessed the insidious decline in health and vitality that was accepted by the medical community and most patients as a normal part of life. Rejecting this normal philosophy, he began practicing bio-identical hormone replacement therapy in 2002 to offer an alternative to those that sought to maintain optimal function in all areas of life.Science Fit promotes optimal function for a lifetime by offering time efficient personal training, dietary education, and also an exciting hormone balancing service called Hormone Fit. Hormone Fit employs bio-identical hormone replacement therapy, provided by Dr. Trey Milligan, to restore important hormones to youthful levels so that exercise and dietary efforts yield maximal results*. Hormone Fit and Dr. Milligan are especially proud to be approved providers of BioTE bio-identical pellet hormone replacement therapy, providing convenience and great results all-in-one. *While the best results from hormone replacement therapy are achieved with the combination of appropriate exercise and attention to diet, Hormone Fit services are available as a stand alone service at Science Fit and do not require the inclusion of personal training services.","trey.milligan@sciencefit.net","405-748-0028","","2350","1259","10\/15\/16","0","1","1","amyso1969@gmail.com"

Barnard, Jr. in Corpus Christi, Texas to form the first group Obstetrics and Gynecology practice in South Texas.As his practice grew during the 1980?s, Dr. Shoemaker became a very skilled laparoscopic surgeon. He realized that sophisticated, operative laparoscopy could lead to quicker recovery for his patients, with much less pain. He also concluded that with minimally invasive procedures, not only was the patients hospital stay reduced, but they able to return to their normal activities within days, instead of weeks.When performing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, Dr. Shoemaker often has his patients back to work  without any restrictions  in as little as seven days. He is considered to be one of the leading pelvic floor reconstructive and incontinence experts in America, and is highly sought after to educate other gynecologic surgeons in his techniques.In January 2011, Dr. Shoemaker added a new dimension to his surgical repertoire with the da Vinci Robot, which has enabled him to perform much more complicated procedures that otherwise would have to be performed using a more invasive form of surgery.He and Bay Area Medical Center broke a world record for the most robotic procedures performed in the first year after the introduction of a robotic instrument with 384 procedures.If youre in need of a reputable and personable ObGyn Corpus Christi TX residents rely on the professional and caring staff at Innovations in Womens Health under the direction of gynecologic surgeon Dr. E.

Whitfield, MD, brings more than three decades of exceptional gynecological healthcare training and experience to women in the Fort Worth, Texas area.After graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas City I relocated to Dallas for a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Parkland Memorial Hospital.  I loved this area, so decided to start my practice in Fort Worth.  What I found were a wonderful a medical community, patients, and colleagues which helped build a thriving practice. Over the years, I have strived to provide compassionate and expert care in a professional and friendly environment.  Practicing obstetrics has been a wonderful opportunity to participate in building families that make up our community.  And gynecology has allowed me to provide care to thousands of DFW women from the teens, through the reproductive years and into menopause.Modern womens healthcare means options and choices. And as medical science develops, so do treatment options. I have strived to stay abreast of the latest developments and have continued to position myself as one who can offer contemporary treatments to my patients. Obstetrics and Gynecology is a very diverse specialty and staying current with developments in essentially two specialties has become a challenge within my specialty. So, after delivering over 2000 babies to area families, I decided to pursue an ongoing passion and focus my practice exclusively on gynecology and gynecologic surgery.What I have found is that more and more women are, in fact, choosing to see someone who specializes exclusively in gynecology and the reasons are many. Your time is important, you are looking for someone who specializes in the problems that pertain to you, and you are looking for a higher level of service and care. My staff has been carefully chosen as professional, friendly and helpful individuals who have been thoroughly trained in gynecology to provide expert care in a warm and compassionate setting. We are not just interested in outcomes, but also in you as a person and your story. Furthermore, providing a high level of service exceeding your expectations is our goal.My team and I look forward to meeting you and taking care of your needs. We are excited about the possibility of creating a trusting and caring healthcare partnership with you.","","","9fb15cbad8179920","569","332","3\/22\/14","0","1","1","johnwhitfield@johnwhitfieldmd.com"

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology\/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the bodys inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients, and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.","pa@west2northsd.com","951-302-2000","bce3db3a20780832","2535","1449","2\/16\/17","0","1","0","quinn@joywellnesspartners.com"

Doctor Taylor feels that the patient is her best source of information and by listening to her patients and connecting with them through a one hour initial appointment, she can gain all the information needed to develop a customized treatment plan.Pasadena Bioidentical Hormones Doctor Julie Taylors passion is to help women and men live better, to feel whole, and to be at their best to keep up with all the juggling we do in our every day lives. With the chronic stress many people are under whether its fighting traffic, answering phone calls, dealing with home life stressors, not getting enough sleep and exercise, and even traveling on the plane frequently enough, our hormones can quickly become out of balance. Furthermore, we are exposed to a lot of toxins in our environment through the food we eat and air we breathe that can also wreak havoc on our hormonal balance. In addition, every time a woman has a baby, her hormones reset themselves, which could be balanced or unbalanced. When our hormones become disrupted, every part of our body is affected, from our quality of sleep, to our eating habits, our sex life, our propensity to disease, and the way we look and feel about ourselves. If your hormones are out of balance, getting them in balance can make you feel like a new you!Julie Taylor M.D. was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. She received her medical degree from Michigan State University and completed her MPH and residency training in preventive medicine at Loma Linda University, where she focused much of her training on bioidentical hormone replacement. She went on to complete additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy through the American Academy of Anti aging. She treats patients at her Sierra Madre, California clinic and focuses on preventive medicine, lifestyle medicine, chronic disease reversal,, and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. During the first visit, Doctor Taylor spends a full hour with each new patient, listening to their needs and health goals and develops a tailor-made plan based on each patients goals. Once each patient is well on his or her way to balanced hormones, Doctor Taylor conducts periodic tests to make sure this optimal balance is sustained.","julietaylormd@gmail.com","","1cf7a3acfc645a98","1629","897","1\/16\/16","0","1","1","julietaylormd@gmail.com"

She graduated with her MD from Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio and completed her residency at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. Dr. Karen Kaufman - Passion for Functional MedicineWhile practicing in Boulder, Dr. Kaufman became aware that patients needed and wanted more than what they were receiving from traditional Western Medical healthcare. She observed that while some patients felt better with certain medications including bio-identical hormones, a large percentage continued to not feel well or had even more symptoms because underlying issues were not addressed. Through these observations she became passionate about functional, integrative medical care and incorporating more holistic approaches with patients. As a result, she pursued a fellowship in Functional Medicine to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying triggers that keep patients from experiencing their optimal health. More Time for Personalized and Comprehensive CareDr. Kaufman recognized that she wanted to take more time to investigate and understand the various underlying causes of her patient's symptoms than she had in a traditional medical model. Her current practice, Kaufman Health and Hormone Center reflects a personalized and comprehensive care model emphasizing the partnership between doctor and patient.Partnering With PatientsEach patient is an individual with varying backgrounds, life stressors, medical history and symptoms. Dr. Kaufman takes the time to learn about and partner with each patient to provide more personalized and comprehensive health care to help someone feel better when out of balance.Mission DrivenDr. Kaufman's mission is to provide personalized and comprehensive health care to patients using both conventional medicine combined with her functional medicine training.

I care for a wide range of patients with a wide ranging age population.  I also have received advance hormone replacement training and certification from BioTE Medical. The BioTE Method helps patients feel much better and reduces many of the concerning symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs, such as night sweats, hot flashes, low libido, sleep difficulties, low energy, anxiety, depressed mood, joint pains, lack of mental focus plus many more. This therapy helps patients feel much better and reduces or eliminates many of the annoying symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs. It also helps provide many long term health benefits that are documented in scientific literature.
