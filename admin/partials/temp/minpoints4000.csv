From outset, my practice flourished. Building a practice, providing quality patient care, and developing my skills as a Family Physician were all personally enriching.  I learned more about taking care of people during the first 5 years of practice than my entire 4 years in medical school and 3 years of residency.   In addition, I have earned Board Certifications in both Urgent Care and Family Practice.There are a few extremely important aspects of caring for people that I consider non-negotiable.  1. A doctor needs to be easily accessible to the patient. 2. A doctor must be able to see the patient when they are both healthy and sick. 3.  A doctor must be able to take his\/her time when caring for another human being.  Take away any of these, and I could no longer care for a person as their primary care physician.  Each of these elements is based upon fostering an authentic provider\/patient relationship  one in which the physician has the time to appreciate the patient as a unique human person  and is aware of the complexities of each individuals situation. Take away any of these non-negotiable elements, and I could no longer care for a person as their primary care physician. Over the years, as both my own practice style has matured and the business of medicine has evolved, I have found that my commitment to providing high-quality patient-care, within the context of a genuine provider\/patient relationship, is a standard that I cannot compromise.Medicine is more of an art than a science.  Each person has a unique personality with inimitable strengths, weaknesses and problems.
