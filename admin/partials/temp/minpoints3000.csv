Next he attended Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia where he earned a Master's Degree in Medical Sciences and worked briefly in the neonatal intensive care unit at Grady Memorial Hospital.  Ken and his wife, Andra, got homesick for family and friends and migrated back to Farmington where he worked at San Juan Regional Medical Center as a Respiratory Therapy Supervisor for two years.  He was accepted into medical school at the University of New Mexico where he graduated in 1988.  He then completed a residency in Emergency Medicine at the University of Missouri at Kansas City.  It was back to Farmington again in 1991 where he began work as an Emergency Medicine specialist at San Juan Regional Medical Center, once again, where he was the medical director from 1993 to 2000.  Ken still works there as a staff emergency physician to the very present.  In 2003, Dr. Stradling formed Reliance Medical Group with Dr. Allen Hurt and opened their Occupational Medicine clinic on Butler Avenue, expanding to Urgent Care in 2003.  Dr. Stradling fractured his leg in 2014, and it wouldn't heal!  His orthopedist informed him that his Vitamin D level was low.  This led to intense study of body hormone and vitamin deficiencies.  Friends had told him about BioTE and what they could offer.  Dr. Stradling researched their products and philosophy, deciding he could provide a vital service for the community that was not currently available.  In March of 2015, San Juan Wellness Center was born, offering a wide array of hormone replacement and nutritional supplementation using the BioTE method and BioTE products.","","","4cc228bea02a8fe7","1048","574","2\/21\/15","0","1","1","jholgate@reliancemedicalgroup.com;kstrad@sisna.com"

Low back pain is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. A common cause of back pain is from degenerative disc disease, which may present with radicular pain. Currently, low back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease is not well characterized and imaging studies do not correlate with the extent of pathology. In addition, little is known about the mechanisms associated with the actual progression of degenerative disc disease and radicular pain. As a result, these patients have limited diagnosis and treatment options for their pain and disability.","ericchangmd@gmail.com","714-598-1745","c8da03d11dde04c5","3346","1759","8\/5\/17","0","1","1","gclark@restoreorthopedics.com"

While at Old Dominion University, she worked in the post doctorate biology department as an aide to Dr. James Swanson, one of the pioneering reproductive endocrinologist in the country. She also worked as a nurses aide and nanny. During those four years, she served on the board of the universitys chapter of Habitat for Humanity, was pre-med, and was in the pre-health club, an organization dedicated to help students  meet med school entry requirements. Miranda feels the emphasis put on research through the various outlets at ODU helped shape her medical future.  She graduated with honors. During her nine and half year nursing career, she has worked at Duke University Hospital in Chapel Hill on the specialty surgery unit, Crossgates River Oaks Hospital in Brandon, Mississippi as the charge nurse on the pediatric\/burn unit, and at Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana as a labor and delivery nurse. Miranda relocated to Louisiana to complete her clinical for her midwifery certification. She obtained her Masters of Science in Nursing from Frontier Nursing University, the first nurse midwifery school in the country. Miranda started her doctorate program the same month she graduated with her MSN, also through Frontier Nursing University. That degree, a Doctorate of Nursing Practice, is the highest clinical practice nursing degree and as she explains it, means that its recipients are experts in translating research for other providers and patients alike. Professionally, Miranda boasts a 1.4% primary cesarean rate. She uses vitamin and micronutrient supplementation along with lifestyle modification, and traditional medicine when necessary, to improve underlying causes of illness, not to mask symptoms as conventional medicine does. As an APRN, she has worked at Mint Health in Baton Rouge, Womens Clinic in Abbeville, and is currently practicing midwifery at the University of Arkansas Medical Services.  Post graduation, Miranda has used her doctorate to create online modules for training U.S. Army physicians and APRNs, serve on policy review boards, and be a peer reviewer for scholarly publications. Miranda is married to Haled, a Baton Rouge Police Officer and co-owner\/COO of Saleh Health Spa. They have two young boys, Logan and Duncan, and an adopted dog and cat. The family loves to spend time on their land and is (very) slowly trying to convert it to a personal sustainable living farm. Right now, the boys are mostly enjoying their zip line and mini rock climbing wall while mom and dad are focusing on the spa.

I was born and raised in South Orange County. I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patients specific needs. I am now a BioTE Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.","seapointelamotte@gmail.com","949-218-3001","b6f047b820a52700","2181","1178","8\/20\/16","0","1","1","seapointelamotte@gmail.com"

I was born and raised in South Orange County. I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patients specific needs. I am now a BioTE Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.","drlamotte@sorrentovalleypainrelief.com","858-404-5944","d28eb0a2836d78b6","2166","1158","8\/20\/16","0","1","1","ameet@sorrentovalleypainrelief.com"

I was born and raised in South Orange County. I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patients specific needs. I am now a BioTE Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.","seapointelamotte@gmail.com","949-218-3001","b6f047b820a52700","2181","1458","2\/20\/17","0","1","1","lamottemd@yahoo.com"

Therefore, Dr. Horner joined Success by Design in order to focus on educating patients about proper diet and adequate nutrition, exercise, stress management and hormone balance.  Dr. Horner is compassionate as she knows from her own experience this journey can be a struggle.Dr. Horner received board certification in Family Medicine in 2004. She went on to complete the requirements for fellowship training and board certification from the American Academy of Anti-Aging, Regenerative and Functional Medicine in 2013. She also has received specialized training and certification in aesthetic treatments including Botox\/Dysport and Cosmetic Fillers.quoteThroughout my medical\/professional career, I have accumulated several certificates and degrees, as well as numerous awards and recognitions.  But what I am most proud of in life is my role as a wife and a mother.  Having given birth to my sons in my late 30s, I was concerned about keeping up with two very active boys!  My passion for achieving optimal health is driven by my desire to enjoy my family as long as I can.  I dont want to just watch my children and someday, grandchildren, grow up.  I want to be an active part of their lives!  Dr. Tami Horner\/quote","","","00b0504d2c7245a2","585","337","4\/16\/14","0","1","1","sherrimorrison1@yahoo.com"

Laura has worked as a patient care nurse and nursing supervisor.  She was a nurse manager for the third busiest hospital in the Houston area.Having spent many long years in the allopathic traditional system of medicine and seeing so many unresolved cases, Laura believes in Optimal Health, Natural Choices and Natural Medicine.  To see the system fail in so many places, there had to be something more.  Instead of trying to treat the symptoms, what happened to finding out the cause and working in such a way to help the body heal?Her desire to help patients improve their health and look at a more holistic approach to patient care, Laura returned to school and is now a certified adult primary care nurse practitioner.  A nurse practitioner plays an important role in helping patients with education, prevention of illness, and encouraging wellness.  Nurse practitioners use less drugs than medical doctors and provide high-quality cost-effective personalized healthcare by treating the whole person.  I think of my role as a functional provider like that of an investigatorwhat is the cause.  I find it is rarely one thing going on.  I love the challenge, but most importantly, it is helping my patients get better. While Laura can write prescriptions for pharmaceutical drugs, she will most often work with diet, life-style modifications, and nutraceuticals first.Some of the services she provides include:Hormone optimization for men and womenWellness visitsLab work, x-rays, and other diagnostic testsLyme disease managementPrimary careGynecological exams (including pap smears)Joint injectionsMinor proceduresSkin biopsiesMinor emergenciesWalk-ins are always welcomeLaura also provides IV nutrition and advanced laboratory testing of hormones, thyroid, gastrointestinal and neurotransmitter areas.Laura graduated from Crystal River High School and obtained her Registered Nursing degree from the College of Central Florida.

Geohagen has been a Physician Assistant since 2001. She is educated in multiple disciplines. In 1985, she obtained a Bachelors degree in Teacher Education majoring in Arts & Crafts and Mathematics from the University of the West Indies. With that Degree, she returned to her Alma Mater, St. Hildas High School in Browns Town Jamaica, where she taught Arts & Crafts for a year before she emigrated to the United States of America. After working in the United States for a few years, Madge decided to return to school to pursue another degree. She attended Essex County College where she majored in Biology and obtained her Associates Degree in the same. She then, went on to Rutgers University where she continued to pursue her course in Biology. She was awarded a Bachelors of Arts Degree in Biology in 1997. That same year, she was accepted in the joint program for Physician Assistants at the University of Medicine and Dentistry and Seton University. Her studies culminated in her receiving her Masters Degree in Physician Assistants.After graduation from both Universities, Madge was immediately employed by the St. Michaels Medical Center in Newark New Jersey in the Vascular Surgery Department. She was given honor of being the Medical Coordinator for a 13-Million-dollar Clinical trial that was being conducted by one of the Doctors for whom she was employed. After working at St. Michaels Medical Center for 4 years, Madge decided to relocate to the sunny Orlando Florida where she continued to work in Vascular Medicine at the Florida Hospital. With added experience, Madge decided to branch into Esthetic Medicine where she specializes in enhancing the beauty of her clients. Madge believes that if she can bring joy to her clients by the renewal of their confidence, then she would have done her divine purpose, a purpose to serve.Madge has always had a passion for fashion since she was quite young. As a matter of fact, her relocation from Jamaica to the United States of America was due to her being accepted at The Fashion Institute in Manhattan New York to pursue a degree in Fashion Design. She was unable to pursue that degree due to financial restraints. However, in 2016 Madge decided that she would not give up on her passion and she, along with her husband, started on online clothing boutique whereby she is allowed to fulfill her deep-seated passion.Education:Masters Degree in Physician Assistants from University of Medicine and Dentistry at Seton University Certification:Rutgers University - Bachelors of Arts Degree in BiologyUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry and Seton University -  Masters Degree in Physician AssistantsHobbies and Special Interests: Vascular Medicine, Esthetics Medicine, and fashion.

His areas of interest include general obstetrics and gynecology, infertility, robotic surgery, high risk pregnancy, and menopause.Dr. Payne's philosophy of medicine was formed by watching his father practice medicine as a small town general practitioner in west Texas. He believes the most important thing for a physician to do is to stop and listen to his patients. This philosophy allows him to correctly apply the science of medicine on an individual basis. In so doing the doctor patient relationship grows in trust and respect. This belief is reflected in his attitude to treat the entire patient viewing himself as a primary care doctor for women, following them from puberty, through childbearing years, and into and through menopause.

Her Masters Degree in Nursing was from Indiana University for the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner program.  She subsequently received a Post-Masters Certificate for the Family Nurse Practitioner program from the University of Indianapolis.  She has worked in Urgent Care, Occupational Health, Internal Medicine and Primary Care settings.Over the years, she started believing there was something more beyond focusing on medications as the answer to each new symptom.  Instead of focusing on patching up symptoms as they occur, Deb finds much more success in searching for the root cause of those symptoms.  It is only when we discover the root cause that we can truly heal the body.  She uses her thorough discussions with her patients to truly understand them and their unique situations.  With that knowledge, she can then find the cause of the outward symptoms and work to resolve it, which often resolves the bodys distress and many other symptoms that may not have seemed related.This focus on treating the whole person led Deb to focus more on a Functional approach to medical care.  We believe in Patient-Centered Care  where we bring the patient into the discovery process & tailor the treatment to the patients individual needs.We believe in an Integrative, Science-based Healthcare Approach where we focus on the complex interactions in the patients individual history, physiology and lifestyle that can impact health & lead to illness.We believe in Integrating Best Medical Practices  where we integrate traditional Western medicine practices with holistic treatments, creating a focus on prevention through nutrition, diet and exercise; using the latest lab and diagnostic testing, and combinations of appropriate prescribed medications when indicated, supplements, therapeutic diets, and stress-management techniques.","debnp@SHCOcala.com","352-629-5939","4e8851bc3bd0b8bd","1385","767","8\/22\/15","0","0","0","chrissy@shcocala.com"

The recognition came courtesy of a yearly Hampton Roads Magazine survey, which put Dr. Ryder atop her field from 2012 - 2014. Dr. Ryder blends the roles of traditional and holistic medicine. She is one of the few physicians in Hampton Roads who has completed the Institute for Functional Medicine's training program.  Functional Medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs.  By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach, Functional Medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional Medicine doctors spend time with their patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, Functional Medicine individualizes treating the patient.She is well-versed in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, menopausal issues, and the treatment of many chronic medical conditions with acupuncture and herbal medicine.Dr. Ryder is the mother of four boys, and enjoys reading, traveling, scrapbooking, yoga, and being a private pilot in her (limited) spare time.","rmryder@gmail.com","757-410-5462","696a457130b3a98a","2542","1353","1\/21\/17","0","1","1","mytemple3@yahoo.com"

The media bombards us with warnings and tidbits of information extracted from research studies without providing the full picture. Women are left scared to treat their menopausal symptoms and are uncertain where to turn for help.A lot of women also have some form of sexual dysfunction and have been unable to find solutions through traditional medicine.

She then excelled at Eastern Virginia Medical School where she was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  Her training continued at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., where she completed her internship and residency.As a gynecologist I am a teacher, a confidant, a problem solver, and a healer, says Dr. Leao.  I love improving the quality of life for thousands of women through behavioral, medical and surgical interventions.  It is immensely gratifying to cure disease and to alleviate symptoms for women throughout their pre, peri, and postmenopausal years.Dr. Leao says no question is too embarrassing to ask your gynecologist.  Were here to help and weve heard it all.  She advocates that:Sex should be enjoyable and mutually fulfilling throughout your adult years.  Your menstrual cycle should never dominate your days.  Never ignore a breast lump.  One in eight women will develop breast cancer. Of all the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer has the highest incidence and mortality worldwide.  However, it is the lowest in this country due to pap smears.  Receive them at the recommended time interval, and always follow up on an abnormal pap smear. Dr. Leao is a native of Hampton Roads and has been serving the community in private practice for six years.  She is married and the proud mother of three boys.  In her spare time (when not participating in sports with her children), she enjoys reading.","zmlrocks@gmail.com","757-312-8221","8eb16c87aa839e0c","3825","1353","1\/21\/17","0","1","1","mytemple3@yahoo.com"

In my youth I was often found helping with the births of kittens, puppies, and lambs.  I was fascinated with new life. I proceeded through nursing school at Salt Lake Community College and Brigham Young University-Idaho and began the path of helping women learn about their bodies, their needs during birth, and how to feel empowered with knowledge and understanding.  I love teaching women how to care for their bodies and improve their lives.  I have spent the last 20 years caring for laboring mothers and sick infants in the NICU.  I spent two years in the adult ICU setting further developing my skills.   I continued my education at the University of Utah where I studied midwifery and womens health nurse practitioner specialties, earning my Doctoral degree. I feel that this course of study allows me to better care for women with the most up-to-date information, empowering women to make the best choices for their life.I was born in Nevada and raised around the United Statesan Army brat.  I have three boys, one girl, two grandchildren and the most supportive husband ever.  I spend my limited free time quilting, gardening, shopping and being outdoors.

I have practiced in Naperville for the past 10 years and although I have always pride myself on providing the utmost high quality up to date care, I have found that I have a niche in medicine, a knack for a more individualized higher level of healthcare. It has always been a dream of mine to take this special personalized attention and extend it to every aspect of the healthcare experience. And that combined with achieving extensive unique experience in my field, my goal is to give each client a luxury healthcare experience surpassed by none.By now you have likely seen my specialties everywhere, the website, business cards, facebook, etc. Theres good reason for this. Although I enjoy seeing women to take care of all of their OB\/Gyn needs, I have become particularly fond of those areas that help to improve your quality of life. It gives women a certain freedom when they dont have to worry about becoming pregnant when their family is complete, an annoying period mishap at the most inopportune time, irritation from elongated labia minora during exercise or intercourse. I want to help give women their life back by taking care of those gynecological nuisances with minimally invasive in-office procedures without the risks of anesthesia. I always endeavor to provide these procedures not only with unsurpassed customer service but also in a way that will be least disruptive to your work and daily routines so that you can move on to enjoying your life.Hobbies? Well, unfortunately for my amazingly wonderful husband Charles and two absolutely beautiful and sweet 3yo twins, this is my hobby. Right now, I promise you that I eat, drink, sleep, live and breathe bringing you the personalized luxury healthcare experience of a lifetime. But with your continued support, one day, I do plan to seriously get back to, first and foremost, spending time with family and friends and those other small delicacies of life I enjoy. Those include twizzlers, an occasional glass of Moscato, and a very unhealthy obsession for shoes.Thank you so much for reading about me and I truly look forward to welcoming you to The Wright Center for Womens Health.","drwright@thewrightobgyn.com","630-687-9595","adbf4844379d5523","1874","1026","4\/23\/16","0","1","1","drwright@thewrightobgyn.com; Carrie@thewrightobgyn.com"

My initial experience as an advanced clinical provider was working in general medicine alongside family and internal medicine physicians so I am familiar with empowering patients to take charge of health concerns such as annual exams and chronic conditions such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes.  Additional assistance was provided in helping patients to meet weight management and smoking cessation goals.  I look forward to continued expansion of my healthcare experience by working with womens health concerns such as annual and wellness exams, OB visits, as well as other concerns that require the attention of an advanced clinical provider.  In particular I look forward to focusing on helping patients meet weight management goals, and working on expanding the Centers provision of alternative and integrative medicine regimens in particular with the management of balancing hormones and helping women to age healthier.Outside of the clinic, I relax watching Big Bang Theory and Shonda Rhimes television (Greys Anatomy and Scandal, anyone?) and playing games such as Words with Friends and Ruzzle.  I am excited to join the team at the Wright Center for Womens Health, and look forward to the challenge of working on healthcare goals with patients.Dr. Wright is my aunt, and she inspired me to enter the medical field so it is especially unique to have the opportunity to collaborate with her as a provider!","ladonna.wright@thewrightobgyn.com","630-687-9595","83bcb60ea540d72d","1877","1026","4\/23\/16","0","1","1","drwright@thewrightobgyn.com; Carrie@thewrightobgyn.com"

I left Fresno, California to attend the University of California Berkeley, where I double majored in science and humanitarian studies.  Since then, I have moved around the country and explored the world.  Following the footstep of my mother, who has been practicing family medicine, I attended medical school at Tufts University in Boston and earned MD and MBA degrees.  I completed my General Surgery residency at Loma Linda University Medical Center.  During my residency, my interest for reconstructive surgery grew immensely when I assisted in head and neck, trunk and breast reconstruction after big oncologic extirpation.  Following my interest, I trained at the University of Miamis Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery program.  As I approached the end of my training, I developed an interest in being a well-rounded and complete surgeon, one who can treat and manage peripheral nerves, bone and joint diseases in addition to internal organs and soft tissues.  So, I pursued a hand fellowship at the University of California, Davis.During my training at Loma Linda University, I have come to fall in love with Orange County.  I have made it my goal to return to the OC and practice here for the rest of my life. It is a fortuitous opening at the Mile Square Surgery Center that has landed me here.  At the MSSC, we excel at a wide array of surgical procedures ranging from rhinoplasty, craniofacial surgeries, head and neck surgeries, facial rejuvenation, breast surgeries, body contouring, genital surgeries to hand and upper extremities surgeries and many more.I have created the General Reconstructive Aesthetic Plastic and Hand Surgery Incorporated institution (GRAPH Surgery Inc) for the sole purpose of delivering comprehensive care to my patients.As your doctor, I understand how valuable your time is. And I want to let you know how much I appreciate the time you take to be as healthy as you can be.

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology\/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the bodys inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients, and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.","pa@west2northsd.com","951-302-2000","bce3db3a20780832","2535","2157","4\/10\/18","0","1","1","drdean@west2northdenver.com"
