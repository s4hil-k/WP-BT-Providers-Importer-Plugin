Dr. Morse’s own medical history has motivated him to be in the profession where he can help prevent, diagnose and treat others. 

Diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age 17, Dr. Morse has an understanding and compassion for his patients that is fueled by his drive to help people.

Born in 1980 in Corvallis, Oregon, Dr.  Morse has spent most of his life in Eugene. He attended the University of Oregon for two years and followed up with his Business Administration degree at the University of West Florida. While not feeling like his life was on the correct path, he soon started studying at the nationally accredited National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon. He graduated in June 2009 with a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine. He now runs Absolute Health Medical Center with his wife and team of Naturopathic oriented healthcare professionals.

As a Licensed Primary Care Physician, Dr.  Morse can prescribe most pharmaceuticals, order labs, refer to a specialist and act as your primary Dr. . Along with treating many acute conditions like the common cold and flu, Dr. Morse sees many conditions ranging from diabetes to fibromyalgia. Using therapies that boost your body’s ability to heal, many conditions can be improved. 

Bio-identical hormones and Dr. Morse
After a short amount of time of being in practice, Dr. Morse realized the value in his training with managing hormones.  He saw that many men and women are poorly managed on thyroid hormone as well as our reproductive hormones (Testosterone, Estrogen, and Progesterone).

He began seeing more and more women being put on synthetic estrogens without testosterone or progesterone therapy included.  This lack of comprehensive treatment can lead to cancer, weight gain, depression, and many other symptoms.  

The worst of it all is when women are put on NO hormones after a full hysterectomy.  This sets them up for osteoporosis much earlier in life as well as greatly increasing their risk of a heart attacks!  

Dr. Morse strongly believes in giving the body what it needs.  This includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, other nutrients and most importantly HORMONES!!!  Giving bio-identical hormones in safe doses that keep lab ranges at optimal numbers, people can live longer and happier lives through an improved quality of life!
