Dr. Morse’s own medical history has motivated him to be in the profession where he can help prevent, diagnose and treat others. 

Diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age 17, Dr. Morse has an understanding and compassion for his patients that is fueled by his drive to help people.

Born in 1980 in Corvallis, Oregon, Dr.  Morse has spent most of his life in Eugene. He attended the University of Oregon for two years and followed up with his Business Administration degree at the University of West Florida. While not feeling like his life was on the correct path, he soon started studying at the nationally accredited National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon. He graduated in June 2009 with a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine. He now runs Absolute Health Medical Center with his wife and team of Naturopathic oriented healthcare professionals.

As a Licensed Primary Care Physician, Dr.  Morse can prescribe most pharmaceuticals, order labs, refer to a specialist and act as your primary Dr. . Along with treating many acute conditions like the common cold and flu, Dr. Morse sees many conditions ranging from diabetes to fibromyalgia. Using therapies that boost your body’s ability to heal, many conditions can be improved. 

Bio-identical hormones and Dr. Morse
After a short amount of time of being in practice, Dr. Morse realized the value in his training with managing hormones.  He saw that many men and women are poorly managed on thyroid hormone as well as our reproductive hormones (Testosterone, Estrogen, and Progesterone).

He began seeing more and more women being put on synthetic estrogens without testosterone or progesterone therapy included.  This lack of comprehensive treatment can lead to cancer, weight gain, depression, and many other symptoms.  

The worst of it all is when women are put on NO hormones after a full hysterectomy.  This sets them up for osteoporosis much earlier in life as well as greatly increasing their risk of a heart attacks!  

Dr. Morse strongly believes in giving the body what it needs.  This includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, other nutrients and most importantly HORMONES!!!  Giving bio-identical hormones in safe doses that keep lab ranges at optimal numbers, people can live longer and happier lives through an improved quality of life!

She has worked in many different areas in nursing including critical care, oncology, various surgery settings, medical offices and clinical informatics.  Laura has worked as a patient care nurse and nursing supervisor.  She was a nurse manager for the third busiest hospital in the Houston area.
Having spent many long years in the allopathic “traditional” system of medicine and seeing so many unresolved cases, Laura believes in Optimal Health, Natural Choices and Natural Medicine.  To see the system fail in so many places, there had to be something more.  Instead of trying to treat the symptoms, what happened to finding out the cause and working in such a way to help the body heal?
Her desire to help patients improve their health and look at a more holistic approach to patient care, Laura returned to school and is now a certified adult primary care nurse practitioner.  A nurse practitioner plays an important role in helping patients with education, prevention of illness, and encouraging wellness.  Nurse practitioners use less drugs than medical doctors and provide high-quality cost-effective personalized healthcare by treating the “whole” person.  “I think of my role as a functional provider like that of an investigator…what is the cause.  I find it is rarely one thing going on.  I love the challenge, but most importantly, it is helping my patients get better.” While Laura can write prescriptions for pharmaceutical drugs, she will most often work with diet, life-style modifications, and nutraceuticals first.
Some of the services she provides include:
•	Hormone optimization for men and women
•	Wellness visits
•	Lab work, x-rays, and other diagnostic tests
•	Lyme disease management
•	Primary care
•	Gynecological exams (including pap smears)
•	Joint injections
•	Minor procedures
•	Skin biopsies
•	Minor emergencies
•	Walk-ins are always welcome
Laura also provides IV nutrition and advanced laboratory testing of hormones, thyroid, gastrointestinal and neurotransmitter areas.
Laura graduated from Crystal River High School and obtained her Registered Nursing degree from the College of Central Florida.  She received her Bachelors of Science in Nursing from Regis University graduating Summa Cum Laude, and received her Masters in Nursing from South University graduating with High Honors.  Laura is a life-long learner, and is continuously expanding her knowledge in courses to help improve patient outcomes.  She is a member of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS).","wfma.laura@gmail.com","352-563-2597","d00819598abd3985","3507","1828","2017-09-23","0","0","0","laura.horn.arnp@mydrhorn.org"

She is proud of the work of her and her partners, and she feels they stand out in the community because they continue to be at the forefront of exciting improvements in the field of medicine and specifically gynecologic procedures to improve female health.
About her own experiences at Medical City, she said: “I love the continuity of care that is so central to the field of obstetrics and gynecology. I have patients that started with me when they were teenagers and now are having babies of their own, and other patients that had babies when I was having my own. It is the sharing of these life experiences in the setting of providing compassionate medical care that really inspired me, and I look forward to meeting new patients and growing older together, as well.”
A board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, Sigman divides her time between healthy, normal pregnancies and complicated operative deliveries, and she is particularly interested in minimally invasive surgeries including robotics and hysteroscopy.
Dr. Sigman has been featured in D Magazine as one of the best doctors in Dallas on numerous occasions, an honor among itself, but she also enjoys the privilege of spending time with her husband and two girls. She has a deep passion for music that’s reflected in her love of the piano (she recently held her first recital in nearly 20 years), as well as cooking and gardening.
Regarding serving the greater Dallas area, “We have a varied mix of patient populations and I love the fact that our patients comes to see us for generations,” she said. “In other words, even as the communities change around us, the same patients and families continue to stay with the practice.”

Because of his influence and her own experiences, she’s committed to upholding his legacy by continuing to care for patients with compassion and excellence in medical care throughout her career.
Now a proud U.S. citizen, Dr. Sigman had the honor of attending the Ivy League’s University of Pennsylvania and completed her study of medicine at the University of Texas’ Southwestern Medical School. She was a resident at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
In private practice since 1999, she was the first female doctor to practice at Medical City, now an all-female physicians practice. She is proud of the work of her and her partners, and she feels they stand out in the community because they continue to be at the forefront of exciting improvements in the field of medicine and specifically gynecologic procedures to improve female health.
About her own experiences at Medical City, she said: “I love the continuity of care that is so central to the field of obstetrics and gynecology. I have patients that started with me when they were teenagers and now are having babies of their own, and other patients that had babies when I was having my own. It is the sharing of these life experiences in the setting of providing compassionate medical care that really inspired me, and I look forward to meeting new patients and growing older together, as well.”
A board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, Sigman divides her time between healthy, normal pregnancies and complicated operative deliveries, and she is particularly interested in minimally invasive surgeries including robotics and hysteroscopy.
Dr. Sigman has been featured in D Magazine as one of the best doctors in Dallas on numerous occasions, an honor among itself, but she also enjoys the privilege of spending time with her husband and two girls. She has a deep passion for music that’s reflected in her love of the piano (she recently held her first recital in nearly 20 years), as well as cooking and gardening.
Regarding serving the greater Dallas area, “We have a varied mix of patient populations and I love the fact that our patients comes to see us for generations,” she said. “In other words, even as the communities change around us, the same patients and families continue to stay with the practice.”

In 1988, he married  his high-school sweetheart and began the educational process that would eventually lead to his medical degree.  Dr. Eldore and his wife have four children ranging in age from late teens to  mid-twenties.  He is a dedicated husband and father and loves, above all else, spending time with his wife and children. 
Dr. Eldore graduated from Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995. Afterwards, he and his family moved to Temple, Texas to complete his  OB/GYN residency training program at Scott and White Hospital until 1999. He spent the next 4 years practicing medicine in The United States Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. His desire to return to Texas brought him to Athens in 2003, where he planted roots, raised his family, and has owned and operated Athens Women's & Children's Center ever since.
Driven by a desire to develop new skills and help his patients in different ways, Dr. Eldore developed an increasing interest and involvement in aesthetic treatments. In 2006, he began serving as medical director for a local aesthetics practice, owned by Julie Harrell LE, CLT and began administering Botox and Juvederm after receiving hands on training in California. In 2009, Dr. Eldore and Ms. Harrell opened Ageless Image, a medical spa in Athens.  Ageless Image is now the premier med-spa in the region and, together, Dr. Eldore and Julie offer essentially all types of aesthetic, hormonal, and wellness services for men and women.
In 2012, Dr. Eldore was introduced to bio-identical hormone therapy using pellet implants.  He quickly became fascinated with this therapy and, with great excitement, he incorporated it into his medical practice.  The powerful benefits, the prolonged effectiveness, and the ease of administration made estrogen and testosterone pellet therapy an instant hit and, before long, hundreds of patients throughout the region were receiving hormone pellet therapy through his practice.  He now focuses a large amount of time and effort on providing BioTE, an incredible hormone replacement solution for fatigue, sexual dysfunction, mood elevation/stabilization, vasomotor symptoms ( hot flushes, etc. ), genitourinary atrophy, sleep disruption, weight gain, and much more.  Dr. Eldore is the area expert on bio-identical hormone therapy and, due to the success and rapid growth of his hormone therapy clientele, he was chosen to help provide clinical training to new BioTE physicians and practitioners from around the nation at the company’s corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas.  Over the last several years, Dr. Eldore has provided essential training and insight to scores of BioTE trainees.  He considers it an honor and a privilege to be able to be part of the process that is spreading the availability of BioTE throughout the nation and beyond.

She has the distinction of being able to converse with patients in 4 languages: English, Spanish, American Sign Language and conversational Mandarin Chinese.

At the early age of 7, Dr. Jill knew that she wanted to become a medical doctor. While watching a televised special on the St. Jude’s Cancer Research Hospital she was moved by the impact the doctors had on the lives of those for which they cared. Thus, she continued to pursue this dream while earning her Bachelor of Science degree from Duke University and Medical Degree from the University of Kentucky, where her family is from. After marrying her college sweetheart, further training took them to New York City where she completed an OB/GYN Internship at Cornell University/NY Presbyterian Hospital and residency at Beth Israel Medical Center/Mt. Sinai. 

Dr. Jill decided to become an Obstetrician and Gynecologist because she enjoys “providing care and education to patients throughout their lives”. She is also humbled by the role she plays in one of the most special events in her patients’ lives, the birth of their children. She has had the privilege of caring for women from different cultures and backgrounds, first in Brooklyn, NY where she practiced following residency; then in her 4 years working in the DC area at Kaiser Permanente. 

She has a passion for providing medical care and other volunteer services abroad. She has volunteered in Guatemala and Mexico to educate patients as well as perform pelvic floor surgeries, remove large abdominal masses and surgically treat cervical abnormalities for the indigent populations. 

Currently, in her new practice she has a special interest in bio-identical hormone therapy, she is happy to offer a service that helps women “feel better” as we age, not just normalizes our lab values. She also focuses on cosmetic gynecology, and the evaluation and treatment of heavy vaginal bleeding. “My goal is to deliver a personalized women’s care experience. I am board certified, but I am not your traditional gynecologist. I will provide cutting edge medical care in a relaxing spa setting.”

It is an honor to introduce myself to you. I grew up in Becket, Massachusetts, a small town in the Berkshires. I have been blessed to have wonderful parents who have given me the support and strength to follow my dreams and taught me strong family values.
Being a doctor is a desire that I’ve had since I was 12 years old. I graduated from St. George’s University School of Medicine in 1997 and completed my medical student rotations in Brooklyn New York and my residency training in at St, Joseph’s Medical Center in Yonkers, NY in 2001. My passion to provide comprehensive healthcare and to use wellness to keep away illness led me to choose family practice as my discipline. I became board-certified in family medicine in 2003.
I met my husband in medical school and have been happily married since 1996. We moved to Ashland, Kentucky with our two boys in 2005. I enjoy the small town atmosphere and strong sense of community this area has to offer. I have had the privilege of working for almost 10 years in the Kings Daughters outreach clinic in South point Ohio.
It has long been a desire of mine to provide a whole body approach, to not just treat illness but to promote overall health, happiness and well-being. Throughout my career I saw the negative effects that obesity has on the body, mind and spirit. I myself have struggled with obesity my entire life. I also saw the toll that addiction has in our community, many times afflicting young people just as they are getting into the prime of their life.
I along with my husband opened our practice, Ashland integrative medicine in 2014 to provide a private, comfortable, family-friendly environment where patients can feel free to address the sensitive issues and help us guide them towards a healthier, more productive life.
It is my honor and a privilege to serve all your healthcare needs.

It is not surprising that this youthful inclination led her into medical product design, medicine and ultimately plastic surgery. 
An ambitious student, Dr. Atagi earned dual undergraduate degrees in Design and Product Design engineering at Stanford University.  After graduation, she worked as a biomedical engineer designing and prototyping medical devices.  She was awarded a patent for one of her developments.
Her biomedical engineering experience convinced her to pursue her interest in medicine.  She completed a post-baccalaureate curriculum in chemistry and biology at Harvard.  She then returned to Stanford, where she was accepted into medical school and received her doctorate of medicine in 1994.
Realizing that plastic surgery was the perfect way to blend many of her professional interests and talents, Dr. Atagi completed an integrated residency training program in plastic and reconstructive surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.  Advanced training followed, including a plastic surgery research fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis, and aesthetic surgery training at Grossman Plastic Surgery in Denver.
As a female physician in a typically male dominated specialty, many patients find the option of choosing a board certified woman physician for their care more appealing.  Along with performing many cosmetic surgical procedures, Dr. Atagi has a special interest in breast reconstruction surgery for women with breast cancer.
In a survey conducted by 5280 magazine, Dr. Atagi was voted by her peers as one of Denver’s top reconstructive surgeons in 2003, and as both top plastic and reconstructive surgeon in 2004, 2005 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.  Dr. Atagi is the author of several articles for professional publications and has conducted research studies on breast implants, breast modeling and related psychological outcomes testing.
Dr. Atagi is a member of the Arapahoe Douglas Elbert Medical Society.  Married to a physician, she and her husband have three daughters.","emilye@atagimd.com","","3a063f413c5c43b5","222","145","2013-04-20","1","1","1","emilye@atagimd.com"

Born and raised in Richmond, Va. he graduated from The Collegiate Schools then accepted an athletic scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After college he worked in his family’s real estate and construction business for several years, but, ultimately decided his true interest and passion included medicine and patient care. Subsequently, he applied to and was accepted to the Medical College of Virginia.
Following medical school Dr. Carl did his internship and residency at Chesterfield Family Practice where he had the opportunity to train with multiple specialists including cardiology, pulmonary, orthopedics, endocrine, and rheumatology. He served as chief medical officer in his assigned hospital during his residency, therefore, was responsible for all after hours medical emergencies.
After residency, Dr. Carl practiced family medicine for several years and with the help of his partner developed a busy and successful clinic. Because of his interest in advanced lipid testing and preventive cardiology he modified his practice by joining forces with cardiology. This multi-specialty clinic offered general family practice and cardiology services and testing including treadmill ECG’s, stress echocardiograms, carotid Doppler, and nuclear heart studies.
More recently, Dr. Carl has been the lead physician at Chippenham Family Medicine and due to his interest in geriatrics served as the chief medical officer at Beaufont Health and Rehabilitation Center, an 120 bed assisted living facility. Dr. Carl also enjoys teaching medical students for the past decade and is an Assistant Clinical Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Dr. Carl recently joined with Dr. Tara Dall who is a renowned lipid specialist and diagnostician. Together, they formed AvanceMD which is a membership based concierge clinic specializing in personalized medicine. By understanding each patient’s individual cardio-metabolic risks, Dr. Carl and Dr. Dall are able to determine and treat the root cause (not just the symptoms ) of a patient’s metabolic imbalances which ultimately lead to disease. Suggestive therapies may include traditional and/or natural treatment options. The clinics primary goal is to prevent and/or reverse accelerated cellular aging and associated chronic disease such as heart disease, diabetes, and dementia via sophisticated assessment and elegant solutions. Dr. Carl is currently working on a fellowship in anti-aging medicine.

MY GOAL IS TO GIVE YOU THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE.
Since the age of five, I knew I wanted to be a nurse. I loved caring for my classmates that injured themselves on the playground. In Junior High and High School, I would hide in my grandmother’s spare bedroom and read from her medical textbooks. I enjoyed learning about how the body works and attempting to diagnosis my cousins with the conditions I’d read about. 
In high school, I had the opportunity to take a course to become a certified nursing assistant and this was the start of my nursing journey. I worked in various settings and had the opportunity to care for people of all ages throughout the lifespan.  
My passion has always been women’s health. Just before starting nursing school, I took a course and became certified with the Doulas of North America. I enjoyed being able to work with laboring women and their husbands in their journey to parenthood.  After becoming a registered nurse, I had the opportunity to continue my work in labor and delivery.  The experience of assisting families as they made the transition of adding a new member has left an unforgettable impression upon me.  
I chose to pursue an advanced nursing degree and broadened my scope of practice to include caring for the entire family unit. I had the privilege of attending Frontier Nursing University in Hyden, Kentucky. While there, I learned to embrace a holistic approach in seeking and maintaining wellness.  I believe that everyone deserves an individual approach to their care that caters to their unique needs. My goal is to give you the knowledge that allows you to make changes that will improve your health, well-being and quality of life. 
I have worked in a variety of settings including, medical aesthetics, helping to educate nursing students, bio-identical hormones, and urgent care. These opportunities have allowed me to develop a wide-range of experience in helping to better the lives of those around me. I strive to understand the concerns of those seeking my help and together construct a plan that is attainable. 
I am thankful for an extremely supportive husband who has always encouraged me to purse my passions.  I am the blessed mother of seven children; five daughters and two sons. I enjoy spending time with them and attending their various activities. I enjoy crocheting, sewing, gardening, canning and playing the piano and organ. I also enjoy serving in a special needs activity program once a week and appreciate the opportunity to mingle among and learn from such amazing people!
I believe there is something to learn from every person that we meet.

Dr. Jonathan Komar received his medical degree at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.  He then completed the Residency Program in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) at the University of Washington, one of the top programs in the nation for his specialty.  He then went on to successfully complete a Fellowship Program at Southwest Spine & Sports in Scottsdale, Arizona.  This extra level of training has helped him to gain skill and expertise in the area of state-of-the-art, non-surgical care for spine and musculoskeletal conditions.

Specializing in men’s care, he is the “go-to” doctor for the “weekend warriors.” Inundated by the busy work week schedule, men often use the weekends to pursue high impact and physically demanding outdoor sports activities.  However, when injuries occur, this can start a negative domino effect, leading to a decline in function.  This can be the cause of missed opportunities, not only on the golf course and tennis courts, but in home and work life as well.  Dr. Komar’s rehabilitation approach is to treat the whole person, which includes optimizing physical, nutritional and mental health.  Physiologically, men and women are different, and men are prone to some injuries more than women.  Additionally, in the area of men’s health, there is no “one-size fits all” approach to treatment, and this is why personalized care for each patient is an essential part of his approach.

As a Physiatrist, Dr. Komar’s goal is to help improve your level of functioning, reduce pain, and get you back to doing what you love to do.  Over the past 13 years, he has developed and perfected his skills by taking a multi-faceted approach to patient care.  Treating musculoskeletal conditions requires incorporating effective and proven tactics, as well as more modern state-of-the-art medicine in a multi-disciplinary approach.  


Dr. Komar also has great passion for Regenerative Medicine, particularly because he has personally witnessed the success of this kind of treatment on many of his own patients for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.  Over the past seven years,he has performed hundreds of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections, long before it became a world-wide trend.  Also, as a Clinical Instructor for the Fellowship Program at Southwest Spine and Sports, he provided hands on instruction to numerous physicians in the training program.   

Dr. Komar’s other areas of expertise include spinal injections of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions using x-ray guidance.  He has also performed tens of thousands of peripheral joint injections under ultrasound guidance.  Additionally, he has conducted thousands of exams using Electrodiagnostic Medicine (EMG) throughout his career.  The EMG exam, when performed properly, can guide the clinician to give an accurate and thorough diagnosis, which leads to more effective and appropriate treatment options.  Lastly, Dr. Komar has personally trained and instructed nearly a dozen physicians through each of their year-long intensive training programs, and all of them are successfully utilizing these skills in their own practices and clinics.

Dr. Komar has received numerous awards as a physician.  Patients' Choice honored him with the prestigious Compassionate Doctor Certification, one of a select few physicians, for both 2008 and 2011.  Also, he earned the Phoenix Magazine Top Doc for 2011, 2012 and 2014.  

Giving back to the community, he helped bring PM&R practitioners together by volunteering his time to serve as the Educational Chair for the Arizona Society of PM&R for four years, and then as the President for another two years.  In addition, he previously held the position of Adjunct Clinical Assistant Professor at Midwestern University from 2006 – 2016.  In his free time, he enjoys volunteering for The Boy Scouts of America, which his sons are active members of.

He earned his medical degree from Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1985. After finishing a general medicine internship in Florida, he went on to complete a residency in family medicine at Des Moines General Hospital.

Dr. Barrick cares for patients of all ages with routine and complex medical problems. He is an advocate of preventative medicine, including Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT). Dr. Barrick has received extensive training in the BioTE Method of BHRT. The BioTE Method has been proven to be safe and effective in hundreds of thousands of patients over many years. This therapy is designed to address symptoms and health concerns produced by declining hormone levels in both women and men. The BioTE Method helps patients feel much better and reduces many of the concerning symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs, such as night sweats, hot flashes, low libido, sleep difficulties, low energy, anxiety, depressed mood, join pains, lack of mental focus plus many more. It also provides many long term health benefits that are documented in the medical and scientific literature which can lead to a higher satisfaction in life. A simple blood test will reveal whether you are a candidate for this therapy and if it could work for you. 

Dr. Barrick is one of the few physicians in Colorado that practices a non-surgical injection therapy called Prolotherapy. The very most rewarding part of Dr. Barrick’s medical practice however, is the many wonderful relationships has with his patients.

Dr. Barrick has lived and practiced medicine in Colorado Springs for 27 years. He enjoys golfing, biking, and hiking with his family. His proudest accomplishment is raising five wonderful sons with his wife, Sarah.

After a four-year residency in Buffalo, New York, Dr. Bauer accepted a position in a hospital based OB/GYN practice in Northern Minnesota for three years prior to coming to Colorado.
Dr. Bauer was drawn to be a prolife physician as a teenager when her primary care doctor thought it was her obligation to council her about safe sex and being on birth control. It was frustrating for her and her mother when they assured the doctor she was committed to abstinence until marriage and the doctor told them all teenagers are sexually active. Dr. Bauer then met a wonderful family physician who encouraged abstinence until marriage and believed in them and their commitment to wait for marriage. It was so refreshing to have such a great doctor. This physician then invited her shadow her at a prolife clinic and Dr. Bauer witnessed the compassionate care to women from all walks of life that she herself desired as a physician.

He sought training in the medical field to bring his relaxed and comforting personality into the world of healing.
 
Doug brings a wealth of knowledge to primary care from his earlier years of practice in a variety of specialties as a nurse and then as a nurse practitioner. As an RN, he worked in a diabetes unit at Bergan Mercy, and then transferred to Bryan LGH East to work in the cardiac ICU. As a NP, he has specialized in treating clients with many different autoimmune diseases and arthritis, to his more recent experience in infectious diseases and wound healing.
 
With many years of specialty training, and seeing a variety of health problems where the immune system fails to keep one’s health maintained, he now focuses on restoring optimal health. This is achieved by focusing on root causes of problems, placing greater focus on issues that ultimately improve a person’s health while allowing opportunity to reduce the need for prescription medications. He uses advanced diagnostic tools while applying functional, ancestral, and natural medicine options, to move a person toward health and wellness. 

In addition, he has enjoyed working with people who are desiring greater health with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and medical aesthetics using laser skin therapy and injectable products. These techniques help deliver greater feelings of health and vitality as well as improving confidence with looks and performance. 

Doug grew up in Nebraska and now resides in Elkhorn with his wife, Steph, of 22 years and his 2 boys. On days off, you can find Doug biking, jet-skiing, boating, and doing home improvement projects. You may also find him at an airport, staying current with his flying skills in general aviation. Together with Steph, they enjoy playing music together, cooking and teaching others about healthy eating and nutrition.","dpenington@gmail.com","402-292-6006","034b94122e1f3a09","2576","1380","2017-01-14","0","1","1","kelli.pavlish@bellevuephc.com"

In 1988, he married  his high-school sweetheart and began the educational process that would eventually lead to his medical degree.  Dr. Eldore and his wife have four children ranging in age from late teens to  mid-twenties.  He is a dedicated husband and father and loves, above all else, spending time with his wife and children. 
Dr. Eldore graduated from Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska in 1995. Afterwards, he and his family moved to Temple, Texas to complete his  OB/GYN residency training program at Scott and White Hospital until 1999. He spent the next 4 years practicing medicine in The United States Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. His desire to return to Texas brought him to Athens in 2003, where he planted roots, raised his family, and has owned and operated Athens Women's & Children's Center ever since.
Driven by a desire to develop new skills and help his patients in different ways, Dr. Eldore developed an increasing interest and involvement in aesthetic treatments. In 2006, he began serving as medical director for a local aesthetics practice, owned by Julie Harrell LE, CLT and began administering Botox and Juvederm after receiving hands on training in California. In 2009, Dr. Eldore and Ms. Harrell opened Ageless Image, a medical spa in Athens.  Ageless Image is now the premier med-spa in the region and, together, Dr. Eldore and Julie offer essentially all types of aesthetic, hormonal, and wellness services for men and women.
In 2012, Dr. Eldore was introduced to bio-identical hormone therapy using pellet implants.  He quickly became fascinated with this therapy and, with great excitement, he incorporated it into his medical practice.  The powerful benefits, the prolonged effectiveness, and the ease of administration made estrogen and testosterone pellet therapy an instant hit and, before long, hundreds of patients throughout the region were receiving hormone pellet therapy through his practice.  He now focuses a large amount of time and effort on providing BioTE, an incredible hormone replacement solution for fatigue, sexual dysfunction, mood elevation/stabilization, vasomotor symptoms ( hot flushes, etc. ), genitourinary atrophy, sleep disruption, weight gain, and much more.  Dr. Eldore is the area expert on bio-identical hormone therapy and, due to the success and rapid growth of his hormone therapy clientele, he was chosen to help provide clinical training to new BioTE physicians and practitioners from around the nation at the company’s corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas.  Over the last several years, Dr. Eldore has provided essential training and insight to scores of BioTE trainees.  He considers it an honor and a privilege to be able to be part of the process that is spreading the availability of BioTE throughout the nation and beyond.

Being an orthopedic surgeon and having treated patients with fractures due to thin bones, he developed an interest in bio-identical hormone therapy as being a solution to help the body increase the strength of its bones.  Studies show that normal bone mass will increase while a person is being treated with bio-identical testosterone and estrogen.  Not only will they help the bones, but the bio-identical hormones protect the heart, brain, and breast.

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans’ clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. 
After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. 
After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. 
My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.
In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.
I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the body’s inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients,’ and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.

Advanced Medicine of Orange County is a medical practice dedicated to using state of the art technologies to restore the entire body.

Throughout all of our treatments we incorporate the use of high dose vitamin IV infusions, nourishing the body with an invigorating boost of energizing hydration. 
Coupled with individually recommended supplements and Nutraceuticals the result is better sleep, increased endurance, improved mood, decreased anxiety, increased libido, greater mobility and a more youthful overall appearance that lasts.

 Broussard Family Practice is a unique clinic in that the goal is disease prevention!  We believe that disease in the body is an interruption, cessation or disruption of the mind, body or spirit.    This, in turn, affects the normal flow of the body system as a whole.   
Since our goal is disease prevention, we believe this begins with a lifestyle changes and modifications that are individualized to each patient.  We focus on proper nutrition with adequate vitamins, minerals and supplements, a consistent exercise program that keeps the body in motion and attention paid not only to the body but also to the mind and the spirit.  We believe that working towards the body being in total balance will bring a harmonious state within the mind, body and spirit thus making you less susceptible to disease!
However, if disease is already present in the body we will focus on management and healing to work towards the goal of a harmonious state within the entire body.

She helps replace stress, fear, anxiety in her patients and instills a sense of inner calm and peace by educating and inspiring them to take proactive steps towards health and healing. She has helped thousands of people transform their lives through the ways they think, feel, and act.
Intuitively, Dr. Cynthia has known that she would serve this calling since the age of five, after accompanying her physician mother to the medical clinic in their home country of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. There, she witnessed the pure hands-on art of healing, free from the modern-day challenges of drugs, bureaucracy, and the threat of malpractice.
This experience laid dormant deep within her as she navigated her American life, completed her modern medical training at Harvard Medical School, and subsequently began practicing Western medicine. It wasn’t until the opening of her own wellness center three years ago—where she guided her patients to experience tremendous improvement in their health and well-being through integrative lifestyle practices that focused on nutrition, fitness, and spiritual or meditative practices—that those early childhood memories of the art of self-directed healing were reawakened.
Rediscovering her life purpose has inserted authenticity to her work and filled her with joy, energy and spirit. She believes the mind-body connection for health is best served through the practice of being centered and present in each moment. A practicing Buddhist, Dr. Cynthia is on a mission to deliver that message, best outlined in her new book, Your Vibrant Heart: Restoring Health, Strength & Spirit from the Body’s Core.
As one of the best holistic doctors in Burbank CA, Dr. Cynthia manages two successful cardiology clinics and is the founder of Revitalize-U, a wellness center focused on health, nutrition, weight loss, and detoxification. Beyond her academic and professional achievements, she is most proud of the praises that she receives from her patients who describe her style of practice as caring, compassionate, service, and excellence oriented.

She offers a wide range of services, skills, and knowledge, while being devoted to the care of women throughout their everyday lives.

One of Doctor di Lorenzo’s specialties is Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, and during the last fifteen years, she has treated over 3,000 patients with custom tailored Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapies.

Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy helps to replenish and balance hormones in the body with hormones that are identical to those produced naturally. Customized Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy plans are available, and Doctor di Lorenzo of Camden OBGYN in Saint Mary’s, Georgia has helped many patients to regain balance and vitality with her expert treatment plans.

Thousands of women that come into Doctor di Lorenzo’s practice are suffering from the effects of reduced hormone levels that accompany perimenopause and menopause. Many women experiencing hormone decline often have symptoms that include fatigue, low libido, weight gain, thinning hair, anxiety, depression, thinning bones, or vaginal dryness. Correcting imbalances can help women to regain their quality of life and sense of wellbeing. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy offers women a natural solution to hormone decline. Bioidentical hormones are identical in chemical structure and function to the hormones produced in the human body, which can allow them to be easily used with few to no side effects.

While women most commonly experience symptoms of hormone decline, men also can experience changes with dropping hormone levels. Some of the symptoms that men can encounter include muscle atrophy, fatigue, hair loss, poor workout performances, anxiety, erectile dysfunction, and low libido. Replenishing deficient hormones can allow men to recover from imbalances and improve overall levels of health and wellness.

She then completed a family medicine residency at the UT Southwestern Health Science Center in Dallas that included training at St. Paul University Hospital, Parkland Hospital and Children's Medical Center. She is board certified in Family Medicine. Prior to attending medical school, Dr. Wood was a registered dental hygienist who practiced many years at an Arlington dental office. She obtained her dental hygiene training from University of Michigan.
Osteopathic medicine's emphasis on prevention, the interaction of all the bodies' systems and the treatment of the total body in order to achieve and maintain health attracted Dr. Wood to pursue her medical education at an osteopathic medical school (D0). From there, she chose a residency at an allopathic (MD) health care system. This allowed her to draw knowledge from both disciplines of medicine and also to take advantage of the vast patient base in the UT Southwestern system where she was exposed to a wide range of pathology and health care needs. She received this residency training at the busiest county hospital and children's hospital in North Texas. She remains steadfast in her belief in all the osteopathic tenets and she utilizes this philosophy in treating her patients. She practices the osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT) that she learned in medical school to promote the health and healing of her patients. She addresses the patient's physical, mental and spiritual well-being since each contributes to an individual's overall health. She welcomes patients of all ages, from infancy to the elderly.
Dr. Carol Wood has developed an interest in bio-identical hormone therapy in recent years. After diagnosing hormone dysfunction, she prescribes replacement hormones that closely resemble those naturally produced in our bodies and follows the levels of these hormones to ensure that each patient's levels are appropriate. Dr. Wood is excited to now offer hormone pelleting utilizing bio-identical hormone pellets.
Dr. Wood and her husband Barry have 2 grown children, Scott and Kristy. The Woods attend First Baptist Church in Midlothian where they live. Dr. Wood's interests include Bible studies, hiking, camping and reading.

After a thorough education including a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from the University of Florida in 2010, a Masters in Nursing in 2006, and years of working in a healthcare system that revolves around insurance starting with home health care as a graduate from the respiratory care program at Santa Fe Community College in 1995, Lisa knew there had to be a better way. 
Her years in a primary care where the expectation was to see each patient for less than 15 minutes pushed Lisa to seek out a new model for health care, a model that put the patient at the center not billing codes and government requirements. Opening a practice was a dream. But that dream was always at the mercy of rapidly changing insurance laws and heavy burdens placed on health care providers by insurance companies. Late in 2014, after reading an article about direct primary care everything changed as new options came into focus. Options like earning a living and getting to spend a lot of time with patients while making a lasting positive impact on their health. The direct primary care model allows just that.

Over the years I have gained great knowledge and as a woman I have been able to put much of this knowledge into practice on myself, being both student and patient.  You see I am also an educator.  I believe that knowledge is power, but it must be shared.  My latest endeavor is getting my master’s degree.  We should never stop learning.  As I reflect on the path I have been on and now the path that lies ahead, I hope to share all that I can with you.  As both a working wife and mother I know first hand that we as women often times put ourselves last.  It has become my mission in life to offer the very best medical care, in particular when it comes to women’s overall health and well-being.

Dr. Pena explained that she was amazed at how God made us and how everything works together. She quickly realized, right then and there, that her calling was to become a doctor. 
It was while Dr. Pena attended the medical school at George Washington University in Washington, DC. That she decided OB/GYN was going to be her specialty. During rotations she saw firsthand the critical decisions that women had to make, some of them life altering. Dr. Pena felt that the field of women’s health would force her to really carry out her beliefs and philosophy about her passion for life.

Wade Boatwright specializes in minimally invasive surgery and female pelvic reconstructive surgery. He is certified in the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System. He has been performing laparoscopic hysterectomies since 1991. Known as early advocate for minimally invasive surgery, Dr. Boatwright is one of the few gynecologists in the area who performs the total laparoscopic hysterectomy through a single small incision. Medical advancements in surgery have changed what used to be a 3-day hospital stay, into a 23- hour outpatient observation. This means less cost for the patient and quicker recovery time and back to work in as little as 7 days! Ask if you are a candidate.

Dr. Boatwright has been in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology since 1988 and is Board Certified in Gynecology and Obstetrics .

Dr. Boatwright grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, graduated from Davidson College. He is married and has two grown daughters. His interests include equestrian sports, tennis, and outdoors activities.

Cook prides herself in listening to and connecting wtih her patients. She
feels that 50% of the ability to diagnose a problem comes from truly
listening to the patient. To that end, Dr Cook provides 100% of the care of
each patient: there are no ancillary providers or nurse practitioners
involved in the treatment of her patients.
Dr Cook graduated Magna Cum Laude both from Spelman College and the
Medical College of Georgia. She then completed four years of residency at
Eastern Virginia Medical School where she received awards for her work in
research. The award that she covets the most, however, is ""The Most
Compassionate Resident"" award she received.
Dr Cook worked full time for Wellstar for 8 years and for 2 ½ of those
years also operated a medical weight management office part time. During
those 2 ½ years, not only did she maintain her full time position and
independently operate a business, but she also raised 2 children and
helped care for an ailing parent. Like many women trying to balance a
career, raise a family and help care for aging parents, Dr Cook felt like she
needed to take more control of her destiny. Therefore, she decided to open
her own gynecology practice in addition to the weight management office.
This gives her better control of her schedule and allows her to both do
what she loves and spend more time with her family.
Dr Cook both practices and lives within Cobb County, GA. She is married
and has two small daughters

He had been in private practice outside of Boise, Idaho before moving to Liberty with his family.
After graduating Cum Laude from Duke University, Dr. Burroughs earned his medical degree from Wake Forest University. Dr. Burroughs received residency training at the University of Utah where he was named Chief Resident for his final year of training.
Dr. Burroughs enjoys teaching and tries to incorporate this into his practice. He believes that the doctor-patient relationship should be one of partners working toward improved health. He uses a focus on evidence-based medicine to counsel his patients and involve them in making decisions for treating acute illness as well as for preventive care visits.
Family medicine provides a wonderful and exciting variety of challenges every day in the office and in the hospital. Dr. Burroughs loves the opportunity to work with patients of all ages: from newborns to ninety-year olds (and beyond). He was drawn to family medicine by the opportunity to prevent chronic disease(such as heart disease, diabetes and emphysema) andpromote lifestyle changes (such as weight loss and smoking cessation).  By seeing entire families in a practice, the family physician often gains a more complete understanding of the obstacles (and assistance) that a patient may have in obtaining their goal of excellent health.
Dr. Burroughs is a member of the medical staffs of Liberty Hospital and North Kansas City Hospital. He is a medical director of two local nursing homes as well as Crossroads Hospice. He serves as a volunteer physician for Liberty High Schools athletic teams. He stays active outside of the office keeping up with the schedules of his four children and coaching youth soccer. He plays soccer and is traveling the country (slowly) running marathons.

She provides a wide range of care for all ages, including a variety of preventive services. 
Dr. Reihsen’s interest in medicine started at a young age as a result of her experiences.  In third grade she was diagnosed with hearing loss.  Over the course of the next 10 years, she had 5 ear surgeries.  During one surgery she had a complication and lost all the hearing on her left side.  She has been wearing hearing aides since that time.  Through these experiences, she developed a desire to learn more about medicine. 
Dr. Reihsen founded Dallas Family Medical in 1997.  During her training, she found her aspiration – to work with patients to help them to achieve their health goals.  Her enthusiasm for medicine has led her to seek advanced training in sleep medicine, bio-identical hormones and allergy treatment.  She sees her field as challenging and deeply rewarding.

Doctors should be directly approachable & responsive (instead of through an answering service), an advocate for you in other environments (in the hospital, E.R., and with other specialists), and a trusted advisor who is accountable to you, knows you by name and cares about protecting your most important asset, your health. A practice should have transparent pricing with no surprises, and be free of government and insurance dictates that oftentimes do not have the best interest of the patient in mind.

Dr. John was born and raised in Texas, coming from a family of 12. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from Texas A&M University, completed medical school at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston, and is board certified in Family Medicine. He joined MyMDbcs in July 2014 and is excited about providing care at a practice that makes possible many of the health care principles he is passionate about.

He was raised in New Iberia and obtained a degree in Biology from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and his MD from Louisiana State University School of Medicine in Shreveport. He completed his Internship and Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile where he served as chief resident. He is a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Dr. Fuller lives in Lafayette with his wife Sarah. They have two grown sons, Ryan and Ben. They enjoy short getaways including camping and hiking in state parks and attending LSU games.



As a gynecologist, he specializes in evaluating and treating hormonal imbalances, including perimenopausal issues, with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. For many years he has performed hormone pellet procedures with outstanding results for his patients. 

A woman has many complex medical issues throughout her entire adult life. From puberty to pregnancy to the perimenopausal and menopausal years, it helps to have an OB/GYN  physician to partner with each patient during every stage of her life.

Along with hormonal imbalances, women have many other associated issues including infertility, abnormal bleeding, reproductive problems, and pain. Dr. Fuller has extensive experience as a women’s health care specialist. His professional interests include care of routine and high risk OB patients and minimally invasive GYN surgery, including being certified to perform da Vinci robotic cases.  Another special interest includes treating heavy vaginal bleeding with outpatient hysteroscopy and NovaSure ablation of the uterine lining. Dr. Fuller finds it rewarding to be able to offer help for all of these concerns.

One thing Dr. Fuller knows after taking care of women for over thirty years, is that each woman’s individual needs must be handled with individualized care. Being a certified bioTE provider, he feels he can offer the best possible plan to evaluate and treat all of the aspects that cause a woman’s hormone imbalance. 

Dr. Fuller also offers bioidentical hormonal testosterone pellet therapy for men. Many men discover how much better their partner feel after her hormones are optimized and want to feel better also. Many men wonder why they waited so long to get tested after seeing how much better their lives have become. 


I am truly honored to have been part of the lives of many women in Acadiana, from the thrill of delivering healthy children, to the heartbreak of infertility and pregnancy losses and cancer.  One of the most gratifying experiences I've had is taking care of three generations of women in the same family. I have also had the amazing experience of delivering babies of mothers and fathers that I delivered.

Compassion, trust, and calmness are virtues I strive for each day, and I feel my years of experience can better help me to care for the variety of medical issues affecting our patients.

In fact, she has a family Christmas card with a picture of her at 2 years old wearing a nursing uniform! Although she had no idea when that idea took root, she distinctly remembers when she decided on a particular focus: in her Nursing Roles class when she opened the gray textbook and read the description of a Nurse Practitioner. At that moment, she knew that role would afford her the higher level of independence and decision-making she desired. Later, she discovered that as a Nurse Practitioner, she could forge a different path to take care of people in a way that aligned with her deepest values—to treat patients as individual human beings, and not their diagnoses.
As a nurse, Jody has participated in the traditional medical system, and as a patient, she has been its victim. While being treated for Crohn’s disease, traditional medicine made her sicker, and she developed lupus. None of her doctors could see outside the box. Fortunately, a friend took the time to listen and was determined to find another option when her doctors failed her.

Finish Line Dynamics is a world apart from that. As a Health Coach who is also a Nurse Practitioner, Jody has the opportunity to play it forward and care for people in the way
she wants to be cared for. Here, an initial assessment is an hour long. She asks a lot of questions about nutrition, mental state, activity levels, and more, to really get to know her
patients and identify the source of the problem. The results are truly amazing! Jody describes a recent patient, a woman in her 40s, was suffering from chronic pain and
fatigue. Nothing was working—not physical therapy, not her chiropractor, not pain medication. Through blood work and genetic and micronutrient testing, Jody identified a
Vitamin deficiency and a metabolism problem. After three days on a supplement, the woman woke up pain free for the first time in twenty years! “What a thrill to witness patients follow a treatment plan and get better!” Jody says. “Here at Finish Line, I can build sustaining relationships with patients that I never could while working in urgent
care.”
Jody’s dream is to affect widespread community change beginning with individuals, usually mothers, and then families. Her doctoral dissertation focused on pediatric diabetes, which is a family-based disease. “If we start with women and children, prevention can spread into the community, ending an epidemic. Mothers can institute
good nutrition and fitness—issues related to diabetes and obesity—in their families, and families can change society.”
Getting and staying fit and healthy can be a fearsome thing, and Jody has faced down her own demons. In her early forties in Minnesota, she was struggling to overcome a weight problem and to get healthy. A friend who was officiating a triathlon invited her to check it out, but Jody was too paralyzed with fear even to go watch. She determined to overcome that fear and enter that triathlon the next year. The following summer, she completed three! The fitness bug had bit her, and she was losing weight, making friends, and slowly transforming herself.
In 2012, Jody joined the Red Ribbon Ride to support the Minnesota AIDS Project, and completed a 300-mile course over four days. As she rode into the state capital, she
decided to join the California AIDS ride the following year, a seven-day, 545-mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles. By the time Jody did that ride in June 2013, she also
had accepted an exciting new opportunity in nursing education in Orange County, California.
The last five miles of that ride were exhilarating beyond belief. The realization of what she was doing hit hard—“Here I am in LA, and a week ago I was in San Francisco, and I
am on my bike!” But not only that—the memory of the emotional distance she had travelled spread out behind her as joyful tears flowed. “So many people had doubted me,
but look what I just did! I knew just how incredibly strong and capable I truly was.”
Jody believes anyone can and should revel in that wonderful, electrifying feeling—to know that you are capable and enough. Finish Line Dynamics is groundbreaking in its
comprehensive, personal, and supportive approach that integrates mind and body.
No matter your age, shape, or size, let Jody help you cross your own personal finish line and claim your optimal health.
(Jody earned a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from Minnesota State University, Mankato, and has practiced in family medicine, pediatric intensive care, bone marrow
transplant, diabetes education, and urgent care settings. She also has taught nursing at the university level and served as an academic administrator. In addition to cycling and
swimming, Jody enjoys movies, Disneyland, and baking. A native Minnesotan, she now finds great peace at the beach.)

A Florida native who was born in Miami, Dr. Edward G. Mackay is considered to be one of the country’s leading vein specialists. Board-certified in general surgery and vascular surgery, Dr. Mackay is one of the few board-certified vascular surgeons in the Tampa Bay area focused solely on treating vein disease and has been doing so since 1999. With three offices in the Tampa Bay area – Palm Harbor, Largo and St. Petersburg – Dr. Mackay is a highly-regarded physician and leader in treating venous disease. He continuously offers the latest in office-based vein therapies that will best benefit his patients.

Dr. Mackay earned his medical degree from the University of Florida Medical School in 1986. He completed a 4-year General Surgery residency at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta and the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. After his residency, Dr. Mackay completed a one-year Vascular Surgery fellowship with the University of Tennessee Medical Center.

When he returned to the Tampa Bay area, Dr. Mackay worked at Morton Plant Hospital in General and Vascular Surgery. He also was part of a larger vascular surgery practice from which he left in 1999 to pursue a practice dedicated solely to treating patients with vein disease.

Dr. Mackay was the first in the state of Florida to offer the RF (radio frequency) endovenous procedure, and in 2001 he was the first in the Tampa Bay area to offer Endovenous Laser Treatment (EVLT). He was among one of the first vein specialists to perform innovative procedures such as Varithena® (polidocanol injectable foam), the only FDA-approved foam for the treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins (GSV), ClariVein® (mechanical chemical ablation) which scores the inside of the vein while dispersing medicine to close down the problematic vein and along with Dr. Jose Almeida, he was the first ever to perform the VenaSeal® endovenous sealant closure procedure, which has FDA approval and Dr. Mackay was the first in the state of Florida to perform the procedure.

Due to his extensive knowledge and experience concerning venous disease, Dr. Mackay is often asked to speak at vascular conferences and symposiums, and he provides training regarding vein treatment procedures to physicians throughout the U.S. and internationally. Dr. Mackay is also an author and co-author for many published articles focusing on vein therapies, including contributing a chapter for Dr. Jose Almeida’s book, Atlas of Endovascular Venous Surgery.

I became board certified in family practice in 2006 and began looking into healthy aging in 2008.  My first “discoveries” were about adrenal dysfunction, low thyroid that is commonly missed by traditional Western medicine, and toxic metals.  Then about four years ago I found out about bio-identical hormones and was astounded at how they helped me, my wife and about 300 patients.  Up until three months ago, I had only heard about topical creams, and some oral meds.  
Then I was exposed to pelleting through BioTE by Gunther Mueller!  Thank you!  I thought the topical was astounding, but I see that pellets have more science behind them and that they certainly work better.  I am more and more excited about the practice of medicine and my mission/goal is to help aging people find help that will keep them active, strong, healthy and productive rather than being “put out to pasture” like so many elderly are in many countries.  When I see patients whose hormones are very low (many women have such low estrogen, progesterone and testosterone that the lab results show “too low to be measured”) and realize that they will likely live another 40 or 50 years with total deprivation of the hormones that kept them young, healthy, active, strong and happy, it really breaks my heart that modern medicine, for the most part, says “be warmed and be filled and go your way” and does absolutely nothing.  How can this be compassion when bio-identical hormones are so easily available?
I saw a middle aged lady a few weeks ago for whom I had prescribed BHRT a year ago.  She told me that she went straight to her doctor and showed the prescription to him.  He said, “Oh, no!  You can’t take estrogen.  You will get addicted to it!”  So, she “obeyed” him and didn’t fill the prescription.  She returned feeling worse than last year and is more open to help.  I explained it all again but more about pellets, and she is scheduled for pellets soon!  So now I can say as I insert the pellets, “Be warm and be filled,” and really mean it and really do something worthwhile for people!","","","9f15192b4c725886","297","174","2013-08-10","0","1","1","eagleswingmedical@yahoo.com"

Her additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy from the Academy of Anti-Aging has allowed her the tools to provide patients with solutions to their health concerns. Doctor Taylor feels that the patient is her best source of information and by listening to her patients and connecting with them through a one hour initial appointment, she can gain all the information needed to develop a customized treatment plan.
Pasadena Bioidentical Hormones Doctor Julie Taylor’s passion is to help women and men live better, to feel whole, and to be at their best to keep up with all the juggling we do in our every day lives. “With the chronic stress many people are under whether it’s fighting traffic, answering phone calls, dealing with home life stressors, not getting enough sleep and exercise, and even traveling on the plane frequently enough, our hormones can quickly become out of balance. Furthermore, we are exposed to a lot of toxins in our environment through the food we eat and air we breathe that can also wreak havoc on our hormonal balance. In addition, every time a woman has a baby, her hormones reset themselves, which could be balanced or unbalanced. When our hormones become disrupted, every part of our body is affected, from our quality of sleep, to our eating habits, our sex life, our propensity to disease, and the way we look and feel about ourselves. If your hormones are out of balance, getting them in balance can make you feel like a new you!”
Julie Taylor M.D. was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. She received her medical degree from Michigan State University and completed her MPH and residency training in preventive medicine at Loma Linda University, where she focused much of her training on bioidentical hormone replacement. She went on to complete additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy through the American Academy of Anti aging. She treats patients at her Sierra Madre, California clinic and focuses on preventive medicine, lifestyle medicine, chronic disease reversal,, and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. During the first visit, Doctor Taylor spends a full hour with each new patient, listening to their needs and health goals and develops a tailor-made plan based on each patient’s goals. Once each patient is well on his or her way to balanced hormones, Doctor Taylor conducts periodic tests to make sure this optimal balance is sustained.

	Tiffany Richey is a Family Nurse Practitioner, board-certified by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and licensed by the Oklahoma State Board of Nursing to provide exceptional healthcare to patients across the lifespan. Her scope of practice encompasses health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and management of common and complex health care problems.

	Tiffany began her career in the health field as a certified dental assistant in 2007 in Cedar Hill, Texas.  There she became interested in pursuing a career in disease prevention and promotion as a nurse practitioner.  She graduated in 2013 with a BSN from Oklahoma Christian University and most recently acquired a MSN from South University of Georgia with a specialty in Family practice.  She eventually plans to obtain a Master’s degree in Functional Medicine.  

	Her experience as a registered nurse has primarily been in the ICU and cardiac CCU where she earned a national certification in critical care (CCRN).  It was here that she learned the devastating effects the environment and lifestyle choices can have on the human body.  Frustrated by the healthcare climate today of treating patients in a health crisis versus prevention led her to seek other options to provide care that would seek eliminating the cause of the problem.  She found a solution in the Functional healthcare approach.  Functional practitioners examine each patient’s lifestyle and unique biochemical factors to identify the underlying causes of their disease and find treatments that help return patients to optimal health. This can only be done through a therapeutic relationship between patient and provider.  Hormone Replacement Therapy is a big part of making this possible.  It is at Encompass Wellness she wishes to pursue these practices with her patients.  

	Tiffany is originally from Edmond, Oklahoma where she currently resides with her husband Bennett and three children.  She attends Oakdale Church of Christ and believes in a Christ centered home.  She enjoys any craft that can provide a creative outlet, specifically sewing and spending time with friends and family.

She is Board Certified in Family Medicine but has a passion and love for cosmetics.
After completing her residency, she relocated to Ft. Worth to be closer to her family. She was on a mission to find a position in a cosmetic practice where she could pursue non-invasive facial cosmetic treatment as well as a health and wellness program. She was introduced through mutual friends to Facial Cosmetic and Surgical in early 2012 and once you meet her you will know why she was the perfect fit to join our practice.
Dr. Hill is currently in our office on Mondays and Wednesdays. In order to accommodate patients with difficult schedules, she has extended hours of treatment by appointment only. She is currently fulfilling her second goal by expanding into the health and wellness program which includes medical weight management, nutritional counseling and bio-identical hormone therapies.
Dr. Hill had her first child in December 2012, a son named Hudson. She especially enjoys her new role as a mom and loves spending time with her husband and son.

Dr. Adamcik's Anti-Aging Story
I was born a skinny kid. There are 3 basic body types you can inherit, ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorphic, meaning your body hereditarily is skinny, muscle and fat, I was born ectomorph or basically skin and bones. The kids used to joke if I turned sideways I would become invisible.
Like most young adults, after I finished high school and all organized sports, my exercise evaporated, and I continued to eat an unhealthy high calorie diet full of cakes, cookies, ice cream, cereal, etc. The result was I became a fat skinny kid. I still had no muscle, but I was beginning to get a significant gut.
By 1984, I could see the changes in the mirror and I adopted a rigorous exercise program. This included both aerobic exercise and vigorous weight training. My diet was still bad, but I was able to get rid of most of the fat and started to slowly build muscle. In 1987, brainwashed by the medical profession, I started a heart-healthy low fat diet. The translation of low fat essentially means high carbohydrate, as energy calories are predominately one or the other. As I continued the exercise, I built more muscle. But I was not able to lose fat and by 2000 I had put on a fair amount of weight in the middle again. My hormones were likely already declining by then as I was mid-40’s and I was unaware of the issue, as was most of the medical profession at that time.
In 2000, I had a sudden enlightenment and challenged the low fat diet mantra I had believed since medical school. I reviewed all of the dietary literature and studies that lead to that recommendation. I learned that the low fat diet was a fallacy based on wrongful interpretation of studies. There was significant data available to recommend a truly heart healthy diet. Hence I began work on my book “The Globes Best Diet” while I experimented on myself with various diets, and I monitored the results with frequent blood testing. The results where truly phenomenal and I lost most of my belly fat again. The diet was one that restricted carbohydrates and focused on healthy protein sources, vegetables, fruit and nuts.
For the next 8 years, I worked vigorously on a low carb/high protein diet along with both aerobic and weight training exercise program. My health was hitting new high highs, but I seemed to hit a wall when it came to further improvements.
In 2008, I added a testosterone level to my routine blood test.  To my shock at the time, it was low.  Now in retrospect, it would have been obvious had I known what I know now.  I was already 55, a time when hormone decline is rampant.  And I was fatigued, had diminished drive and was still unable to shed middle weight in spite of incredible diet and exercise program.  My physician recommended hormone replacement therapy, and my body began to improve dramatically and quickly.  I was able to break through some of the wall that had appeared and improved my muscle mass while again shedding some middle weight.  At that time, I looked into anti-aging and decided against it as I thought it was hooey.
In 2011, I had another life changing event. My energy levels declined drastically over a 4-month time period. All of my physicians were baffled and traditional blood testing was negative. My fatigue was so bad I resorted to napping on my lunch rather than work out and I would go to bed at 5 PM! When the alarm went off I would wake up exhausted. What could possibly be wrong? I wasn’t depressed. By chance, I decided to attend a conference that included topics of weight loss, cosmetics, and anti-aging.
I was amazed at the wealth of information available on anti-aging and I thought it would bring medicine to a whole new level. Of particular interest were the discussions on subtle hormone deficiencies of adrenal and thyroid glands which are very difficult to diagnose but cause symptoms similar to mine. Out of the blue, one of the doctors there came up to me and announced that my physical features where those of someone with severe adrenal problems and that I should start treatment immediately!
 
I was quite excited to do these advanced tests on my return. I started adrenal treatment immediately as directed. I began to feel better rapidly as my energy levels improved. When the results returned, I was shocked to find out the stranger was right and my adrenals were wiped out! It was a diagnosis that could not have been made by conventional physicians. Even when I showed my primary doctor and an endocrinologist, they were still in disbelief. They were just not enlightened to anti-aging.
Spurred by my dramatic improvement in energy and mental alertness, I delved into anti-aging further, and proceeded to more conferences and took the anti-aging certification test. I learned that everybody starts hormonal decline starting at age 20, So I started optimizing all of my hormones. The results were phenomenal. I am now in the best shape of my life approaching 60. Belly fat has evaporated, muscle mass has increased, energy levels are through the roof, sexual function is like a man in his 20’s, and mental alertness is super. I am a total believer.
This doesn’t have to be just my story. I can make the same changes for you! Make an appointment to our state of the art anti-aging clinic and see the results yourself!

I subsequently served as an active duty Air force Obstetrician and gynecologist at the United States Air Force Academy and Evans Army Community Hospitals for 4 years.  During this time I performed 250 deliveries and over 300 hundred surgeries.  I also have received the Physician of the Year Award in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Evans Army Hospital in 2006, and the Meritorious Service Medal from the United States Air Force in 2007.  I have been in private practice in Colorado Springs since 2007, and joined Front Range Obstetrics and Gynecology in December 2011.

I am certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and am a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  I am also certified by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry and can interpret bone density scans performed in our clinic.  I served as the Junior Fellow Chair in the Armed Forces district for the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and remain active in the College. I am a member of the El Paso county medical society. I was recently named the Top Gynecologist in Colorado Springs by Style magazine in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, along with multiple national awards.  I have active privileges at Penrose hospitals and Memorial hospitals

In addition, I have received advance hormone replacement training and certification from BioTE Medical. The BioTE Method is a proven therapy designed to address the symptoms and concerns of hormone decline in both women and men. This therapy helps patients feel much better and reduces or eliminates many of the annoying symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs. It also provides many long term health benefits that are documented in the scientific literature. A simple blood test will reveal if you are a candidate for and whether you would receive benefit from this therapy.

I am accepting new patients of all age ranges, and continue to practice office and surgical gynecology only.

School of Medicine and completed her residency at Kosair Children’ts Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky in 1994.  She has practiced primary care pediatrics in several communities in the greater Louisville area.
 
She has balanced family with medicine throughout her career, which has been crucial in teaching her valuable lessons.

Philosophically, Dr. White has always been a minimalist when it comes to medical care, believing that less is usually better.  She also believes that parents know their children and that knowledge empowers them to understand what is going on so that they can navigate their children’s health needs.  That frequently separated her from mainstream conventional medicine.  But armed with lots of stories from raising her own children, she continued to maintain that children are resilient and giving their bodies a chance to heal on their own trumped most medical interventions.
 
It was her own health crisis that pushed her further into investigating options outside of conventional medicine.  She knew the “treatments” that conventional medicine had to offer and understood that they were only treating symptoms… not addressing the underlying issues.  She ultimately came to a place of deep healing through changes in nutrition and supplementing with what her body needed… not a bunch of prescription medications.  

As she learned more, she knew that she wanted to be a part of teaching other people how to heal their bodies and encourage their spirits.  In early 2016 Dr White started formal fellowship training in functional medicine through the Metabolic Medicine Institute and the Institute for Functional Medicine.  Through this training, she has deepened her belief that our bodies are created to heal… and that less “medical” intervention is usually more… and that her role as a physician is to partner with her patients in the healing process.

DeAn ","Strobel","MD FACOG","EDUCATION: Bachelor's Degree of Mathematics and Spanish at Northeast Louisiana University, Monroe Louisiana, Graduate School in Engineering at Louisiana Tech University Ruston Louisiana, Medical School at Louisiana State University Medical Center Shreveport, Louisiana, Residency at Baylor University Medical Center Dallas, Texas.
Dr. G. DeAn Strobel is a native of northeast Louisiana where she grew up on a farm on the Mississippi River delta. She attended Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe, LA where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and Spanish. She attended graduate school in engineering at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, LA but decided that biological sciences and medicine was where she truly belonged.
Dr. Strobel then moved to Shreveport, LA where she attended Louisiana State University Medical Center. She had always liked surgery but also found a new interest in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Strobel enjoyed the combination of basic medicine, specialty studies, and surgery. She also enjoyed the knowledge that she would be able to follow her patients for many years and get to know them and their families well.
After deciding to pursue a career in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology, Dr. Strobel moved to Dallas, TX to do her residency at Baylor University Medical Center. She completed her residency training in 1999.
Just prior to completing her residency, she met her future husband Dr. Winston Marshall, an Interventional Cardiologist who was also in his last year of training. They married after a short courtship and moved to Sherman, TX where they began their respective practices.
Dr. Strobel originally practiced both obstetrics and gynecology. She became pregnant with twins and was forced to stop practicing obstetrics when she developed some pregnancy complications. Thankfully, the pregnancy resulted in the birth of two wonderful and healthy baby boys in 2001. Dr. Strobel was forced to make a difficult decision. She decided to not return to practicing obstetrics in order to have a more ""normal"" and predictable home life for she and her sons.
Because of her decision, Dr. Strobel has been able to focus her attention and energy into developing a clinic that is more attentive to the patient. She concentrates on treating the whole woman, not just the numbers. She has also developed a Medical Spa called Allure Laser and Medical Spa. There, she is able to treat more of the cosmetic concerns, which can sometimes lead to significant anguish or stress to the patient.
Together Dr. Strobel and Lee Fisher are able to focus on caring for the female patient as a whole person and not just a diagnosis. At our clinic, we strive to make the patient feel like an individual. We are open and encourage communication. Come see the difference when it's ""Women Caring for Women"".","","","9bf37e1fdf67a752","106","91","2012-11-28","2","1","1","dcosper@trlx.com;destrobel@trlx.com"

“I love people and thought I would enjoy the developing relationships with women patients. I am good with my hands and thought I could develop into a skilled surgeon. It was important to me that whatever I chose to do, it involved helping people and making individual lives better. Ob/Gyn is the perfect platform for making a difference in the lives of women and families. I feel that I have the best job in the world – I am a one-woman welcoming committee for babies as they enter the world. And I am there for women as they age and become mothers and grandmothers.
“I enjoy the feeling that what I do makes a difference in people’s lives. I also feel that I am serving God through what I do. I hope that women can see that in me and know that they are nurtured and cared-for. I provide a clean, upscale environment so that patients can feel at home the moment that they walk into the facility. I also hope to give my patients information that empowers them to make good health decisions.
“My best quality as a practitioner is my ability to communicate and explain things in a down-to-earth way. Also, I am a skilled and experienced surgeon. I see my role as that of an educator. I outline the choices that the patients have and help them come to an educated decision about their health. I treat each person as I would want to have my sister or myself treated. I take joy in the success of others. I receive feedback every day from women who are grateful for the treatment that they are getting, and that provides nourishment for the soul and validation for my approach.”
In her spare time, Dr. Stewart loves dance and movement and taking salsa dance classes. She feels that God has called her to her vocation. She is also a Reiki Master.

Type 2 Hypothyroidism

Dr. Starr’s progressive approach to alternative medicine offers cutting-edge therapies designed to accelerate the healing of hypothyroidism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia, Candidiasis, acute and chronic injuries, sprains, strains and fractures.

In Dr. Starr's description of Type 2 Hypothyroidism, he presents overwhelming evidence showing a majority of Americans suffer this illness, which is due to environmental and hereditary factors. Laboratory testing used to diagnose hypothyroidism is inadequate, and current treatment for hypothyroidism is relatively ineffective. Groundbreaking research shows how persistent environmental toxins prevent thyroid and other hormones from working properly. 

Brief outline of benefits and training for proper treatment of hypothyroidism 

1.	A large majority of the populace has the illness.
2.	Low thyroid causes accelerated atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Proper treatment of hypothyroidism reduces the incidence of heart attacks incidence over 90% relative to the Framingham study.
3.	Diabetes incidence is greatly reduced. Those suffering DM have few complications due to avoidance of atherosclerosis.
4.	The majority of hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides) is avoided or resolves with treatment.
5.	The risk of developing hypertension is minimized. A majority of people with preexisting hypertension will normalize after proper treatment of hypothyroidism.
6.	Congestive heart failure is largely avoided. It is also reversed in most patients suffering with the problem.
7.	Arthritis is largely avoided and often reversed in those already suffering.
8.	A majority of menstrual problems and problems associated with pregnancies are avoided or reversed.
9.	Babies born are very robust if their mother is treated prior to becoming pregnant.
10.	The immune system is greatly enhanced.
11.	Obesity is greatly reduced, especially when combined with nutrition and exercise.
12.	Depression and mental illnesses are greatly reduced.



c.) I will discuss the usage of desiccated thyroid and compounded T3 and T4 as well as different types of iodine. Also, a very short discussion on glucocorticoids usage for mild adrenal deficiency.
d.) Target audience level is for everyone.



Short Description and Outline:
Dr. Starr will discuss the cause and successful treatment for the plague of illnesses affecting western civilization; including heart attacks, depression, diabetes, strokes, headaches, chronic pain and fatigue, and many more health issues. He presents overwhelming evidence showing a majority of Americans suffer this illness, which is due to environmental and hereditary factors.

•	Hypothyroidism is Myxedema
•	Type 1 Hypothyroidism vs. Type 2 Hypothyroidism
•	Mitochondrial illnesses are a primary form of 
Type 2 hypothyroidism
•	Hypothyroidism in children
•	Enviormental toxins effects on thyroid
•	Historical perspectives regarding testing for hypothyroidism
•	Hypothyroidism and cholesterol
•	Actions of Iodine and proper usage
•	Relationship between PH, voltage, health and hypothyroidism



Learning Objectives:
1.	Participants will be able to diagnose and treat hypothyroidism effectively.
2.	Learn proper treatment of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis
3.	Learn the importance of dental problems and how they relate to adrenal deficiency.
4.	Review proper treatment with iodine.

Her interest in healthcare began at M.D.Anderson Cancer Hospital, where she developed a passion for caring for people living and dying with cancer.  Her career path includes earning several degrees in nursing, including a Master of Science Degree and Post Master’s certificate as a Family Nurse Practitioner. While her clinical focus has shifted from Oncology/Hematology to Family Practice, she continues to see a variety of patients ranging from new born to elderly in age, and has broadened her scope of practice to include bioidentical hormone therapy.  It has been a very positive experience to offer this hormone treatment option to men and women in my community. My personal experience of weight loss, improved energy and focus, is amazing. 

The feedback, returning clients, and new interest in this approach support the use of alternative therapy for those that seek a better way to manage hormone deficiencies.

	I am a double boarded certified physician in the field of Family Medicine and Bariatric (Obesity) Medicine. I completed my residency training at Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, IL. I worked as a primary care doctor for six years before choosing to focus on Bariatric and Functional Medicine. I am a member of American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, Obesity Medicine Association and American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. The urge to select a different approach to medicine was stimulated by the sharp increase of the victims that suffer complex chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, mental illnesses and heart diseases. Acute care approaches to the management of health situations fall short addressing individual health conditions. Thus, a functional approach to the delivery of acre is bound to offer a comprehensive mechanism to address chronic diseases to the society. Welcome to our clinic whereby health is a holistic concept. Green Circle Wellness Clinic integrates a variety of concepts including diet, lifestyle and even stress factors that may have adverse effects on the health of a patient.

Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery and laparoscopy have always been areas of interest, and these solutions have traditionally been under-utilized by providers who do not have this expertise. Most gynecologic surgeries can be performed with a minimally invasive procedure. This affords the patient minimal postoperative pain and rapid recovery time. Patients can return more quickly to productive, pain-free lives with little disruption in their daily routines and activities.
“My patients consider me warm, friendly and easily approachable. I take pride in listening carefully to my patients and pay close attention to their needs and concerns. I strive to be a compassionate provider. I never rush, and I always ensure that I dedicate sufficient time to address my patients’ issues and concerns to their satisfaction. I offer my patients my knowledge, technology, years of training and a willingness to go the ‘extra mile’ to ensure that their needs and expectations are met. My goal is to make all the minimally invasive surgical options available to all my patients – for better outcomes and better patient experiences.”

She welcomes patients to her gynecological practice as well as the  Rejuvenation center with the hopes of making their life better by ensuring health and quality as we live longer.

She has a special interest in advanced laparoscopy, cervical dysplasia, and minimally invasive surgery.

Dr. Leao earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia.  She then excelled at Eastern Virginia Medical School where she was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  Her training continued at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., where she completed her internship and residency.

“As a gynecologist I am a teacher, a confidant, a problem solver, and a healer,” says Dr. Leao.  “I love improving the quality of life for thousands of women through behavioral, medical and surgical interventions.  It is immensely gratifying to cure disease and to alleviate symptoms for women throughout their pre, peri, and postmenopausal years.”

Dr. Leao says no question is too embarrassing to ask your gynecologist.  “We’re here to help and we’ve heard it all.”  

She advocates that:
•	Sex should be enjoyable and mutually fulfilling throughout your adult years.  
•	Your menstrual cycle should never dominate your days.  
•	Never ignore a breast lump.  One in eight women will develop breast cancer. 
•	Of all the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer has the highest incidence and mortality worldwide.  However, it is the lowest in this country due to pap smears.  Receive them at the recommended time interval, and always follow up on an abnormal pap smear. 

Dr. Leao is a native of Hampton Roads and has been serving the community in private practice for six years.  She is married and the proud mother of three boys.  In her spare time (when not participating in sports with her children), she enjoys reading.

Kim developed a special interest in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and female sexual health through her experience with women's health.

“I believe that women need a trusted source for information and advice as they enter the menopausal years,” says Kim. “The media bombards us with warnings and tidbits of information extracted from research studies without providing the full picture. Women are left scared to treat their menopausal symptoms and are uncertain where to turn for help.

“A lot of women also have some form of sexual dysfunction and have been unable to find solutions through traditional medicine. Many of them count on Synergy to be their source for information, advice, and solutions, and I am thrilled to now be able to help them too.""

Synergy Integrative Medical Center

Dr. Rebecca Ryder is a board certified gynecologist, a member of the Institute for Functional Medicine, a member of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, and an expert in nutrition.

Dr. Ryder's medical degree and residency were completed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, where she also received her undergraduate degree in Nutrition.
She is a former faculty member at Duke University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, and has completed extensive training in medical acupuncture for physicians as well as herbal medicine.

Dr. Ryder was selected by her peers three years in a row as “TOP DOC” in her field.  The recognition came courtesy of a yearly Hampton Roads Magazine survey, which put Dr. Ryder atop her field from 2012 - 2014. 

Dr. Ryder blends the roles of traditional and holistic medicine. She is one of the few physicians in Hampton Roads who has completed the Institute for Functional Medicine's training program.  Functional Medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs.  By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach, Functional Medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional Medicine doctors spend time with their patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, Functional Medicine individualizes treating the patient.

She is well-versed in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, menopausal issues, and the treatment of many chronic medical conditions with acupuncture and herbal medicine.
Dr. Ryder is the mother of four boys, and enjoys reading, traveling, scrapbooking, yoga, and being a private pilot in her (limited) spare time.

In addition to Family Medicine, Dr. Perkins has a great interest in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT).
BHRT looks at progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone levels in both men and women. Hormones are critical to our body’s health. They are the chemical messengers that tell other cells what to do. They regulate virtually every bodily function. Some of the expected results of balancing hormone levels through BHRT are: look and feel younger, decreased menopausal symptoms and joint pain: improved energy levels, mental clarity and mood: improved sleep quality, sexual function, metabolism and weight control. Patients with chronic illnesses like high blood pressure or diabetes may see additional improvement of their condition.

Robin Fincher is a Certified Nurse Midwife with a special interest in women's health.  She has been practicing for 11 years, devoting most of that time specifically to women's wellness and hormone replacement therapy. In 2012, while working in Athens, TX, she began providing BioTE, bio-identical hormone replacement pellets to patients. This quickly grew in popularity and proved to be a safer and more effective option for patients. In 2014, her commitment to the women in Van Zandt and Kaufman counties led her to begin a private practice in the area to serve her neighbors and friends. Since then, her practice has grown to include women of all ages and even men who are needing their hormones optimized. Treatment is individualized for each patient and may include any or all of the following: Estrogen, Testosterone, Progesterone, thyroid, vitamin D and vitamin B12.

She earned her BS in Nursing from Auburn University in Montgomery, her MS in Nursing from Troy State in Montgomery and her advanced Family Nurse Practitioner Certificate from the University of Alabama in Birmingham.  She and her family moved to Fort Collins in 2007 from Alabama.  She has an extensive background in Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Orthopedics and Dermatology.  Lisa was one of the first Nurse Practitioners to open her own independent Urgent Care and Medical Practice in Colorado following the revision in Colorado Law allowing qualified Nurse Practitioner to practice independent of a Physician.  She owns and operates The HealthCare Clinic of Fort Collins which opened in December of 2011.  She trained under both Dr. Donovitz and Dr. Tutera in 2012 when the company was still SottoPelle.  When the company divided she followed Dr. Donovitz as he founded BioTe Medical.  She is one of the longest practicing BioTe providers in Colorado.  A benefit of coming to a Medical Practice for your Bio-identical Hormone Therapy is the knowledge that if you have any other health questions, concerns or problems then they can be treated at the same location instead of being directed back to your primary care provider, additionally The HealthCare Clinic of Fort Collins is open 7 days a week, this means you can schedule your procedure on the weekend without having to take time from work to get in before the other clinic closes.  Her knowledge and hundreds of procedures along with being a patient herself some 6 years now gives her a unique perspective and understanding of what the patients want and will work tirelessly to achieve that balance with each person.  Outside the practice, she enjoys gardening, camping and travelling with her family.","","","d03d0b0a98c11aa3","15","15","2012-11-28","0","1","1","lisamyers@healthcareclinic.org"

Dr. King believes in getting to the root cause of illness and not just treating her patients with drugs to cover their symptoms. Bioidentical hormones have always been a large part of her practice for both men and women. I realized early on in my alternative practice that many illnesses could be traced back to lack of hormones. I had seen the horrors of synthetic hormones for years and have NEVER used them in my practice. ""When I saw the BioTE methods and their high pellet standards that outpaced many others in the industry, I knew it would be a perfect fit for my practice, and I was right.""

He graduated from medical school at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, Texas and completed a dually accredited AMA/AOA residency in family medicine at Penn State affiliate program where he served as Chief Resident. He has since practiced family medicine in rural Kansas and rural Texas. 

Dr. Petersen is ready to bring his experience and expertise to the greater Salt Lake City area which includes a full scope of family medicine: providing office based care, making house calls, visiting his patients in the nursing home, caring for patients in the hospital, working in the local emergency room and delivering babies. Through this experience he as come to love caring for his patients through all stages of their lives, but he has also seen that there is a disconnect between how doctors practice medicine, and how people can become and stay healthy. He realized that standard therapies and approaches were failing to help many patients with complex conditions.

While working as the Chief of Staff for Collingsworth General Hospital, Dr. Petersen realized that there is a desperate need to approach medical care differently.  He saw that too many patients were failing to see an improvement in their health, in spite of receiving typical and accepted therapies, provided by both primary care and specialist physicians.  He found this was especially true in the fields of endocrinology, infectious disease and women’s health. 

Since that time, Dr. Petersen began to specialize in those areas that are poorly treated by physicians and specialists in the county, including hormonal imbalance, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, metabolic disorders, weight loss, bioidentical hormone replacement, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.  He is a fellow with the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine. 

In addition to providing cutting-edge medical care, Dr. Petersen enjoys hiking, biking, training for Spartan races, playing the guitar and singing.  Dr. Petersen speaks fluent Spanish and enjoys traveling and spending time with his wife and children.

Many understand the important concept of being physically fit but are you Hormone Fit? If not, he can help!

Dr. Milligan founded Science Fit (www.sciencefit.net) as a natural extension of his desire to help individuals look, feel and function optimally throughout an entire lifetime. Practicing as a family physician after completing medical school and residency training at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, he witnessed the insidious decline in health and vitality that was accepted by the medical community and most patients as a “normal” part of life. Rejecting this “normal” philosophy, he began practicing bio-identical hormone replacement therapy in 2002 to offer an alternative to those that sought to maintain optimal function in all areas of life.

Science Fit promotes optimal function for a lifetime by offering time efficient personal training, dietary education, and also an exciting hormone balancing service called Hormone Fit. 

Hormone Fit employs bio-identical hormone replacement therapy, provided by Dr. Trey Milligan, to restore important hormones to youthful levels so that exercise and dietary efforts yield maximal results*. Hormone Fit and Dr. Milligan are especially proud to be approved providers of BioTE bio-identical pellet hormone replacement therapy, providing convenience and great results all-in-one. 

*While the best results from hormone replacement therapy are achieved with the combination of appropriate exercise and attention to diet, Hormone Fit services are available as a stand alone service at Science Fit and do not require the inclusion of personal training services.

Having become frustrated dealing with the end results of bad lifestyles, she has decided to pursue wellness-based medicine, instead of illness-based medicine.

An athlete by nature, enjoying many sports, but especially competitive dancing, she has had the pleasure of having won two US national ballroom dance championships.  After retiring from the competitive arena, she decided to start CrossFit.  An immediate bond was formed. It wasn't until she experienced several injuries and setbacks that she decided to do something proactively.
 
Combining this with the frustrations of traditional medicine, led Dr. Marquette into the field of integrative medicine.  This field of medicine, also known as anti-aging or regenerative medicine, encompasses the whole person, not just their diseases. The goal is to optimize good health and avoid bad choices in order to create a happy, healthy, active person.
Her goal is to treat her patients from the inside out...namely, good nutrition, optimizing hormone levels for the best possible performance, good skin care and, of course, physical activity.
   
Dr. Marquette, along with her partners Quinn Cloninger and Jeff Kaliher, united together to form POW Medical.  POW stands for PERFORMANCE, OPTIMIZATION AND WELLNESS.  It is the goal of POW to bring out the best in each individual to lead a long healthy life filled with happiness and confidence.

She has have never regretted changing careers and loves that she can be part of making positive changes in people's lives.

Barnard, Jr. in Corpus Christi, Texas to form the first group Obstetrics and Gynecology practice in South Texas.
As his practice grew during the 1980?s, Dr. Shoemaker became a very skilled laparoscopic surgeon. He realized that sophisticated, operative laparoscopy could lead to quicker recovery for his patients, with much less pain. He also concluded that with minimally invasive procedures, not only was the patient’s hospital stay reduced, but they able to return to their normal activities within days, instead of weeks.

When performing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, Dr. Shoemaker often has his patients back to work – without any restrictions – in as little as seven days. He is considered to be one of the leading pelvic floor reconstructive and incontinence experts in America, and is highly sought after to educate other gynecologic surgeons in his techniques.

In January 2011, Dr. Shoemaker added a new dimension to his surgical repertoire with the da Vinci Robot, which has enabled him to perform much more complicated procedures that otherwise would have to be performed using a more invasive form of surgery.

He and Bay Area Medical Center broke a world record for the most robotic procedures performed in the first year after the introduction of a robotic instrument with 384 procedures.

If you’re in need of a reputable and personable ObGyn Corpus Christi TX residents rely on the professional and caring staff at Innovations in Women’s Health under the direction of gynecologic surgeon Dr. E. Stanton Shoemaker at his offices in Corpus Christi TX, Beeville TX and Kingsville TX

Dr. Cruikshank moved back to NC to open a Functional and Integrative practice. After 27 years in Conventional Gyn/ Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery I retired. Retirement was not fun(for me), so he followed the long sought after passion. I finished 2 Fellowships-Anti-aging, Regenerative, and Functional Medicine (FAARFM), and Integrative and Holistic Medicine (ABIHM).


Dr. Cruikshank went to Medical School at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. After graduating, he did his residency at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, IA, and a fellowship in Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery in Detroit, MI. He then became the Chairman at three different Universities, after private practice and several faculty appointments. He was a Full Professor at age 39.

Some examples of my service are Aesthetic Regimens, Chelation/Iv nutrition, Exercise Assessments, Heavy metal toxicity, BHRT Pellet Therapy, Thyroid Disorders, Adrenal Disorders, Diabetes / Insulin Resistance, Cardiovascular and Hypertension, Erectile Dysfunction, and a myriad of other services.

Keller, ARNP and I am a Family Nurse Practitioner who has been providing primary health care to residents of Lake county for nearly a decade. In August of 2001, I opened my own office-based Family Practice / Women's Health Center on North Bay Street next to Lake Pharmacy in Eustis, Florida. It has been a wonderful experience for me, both personally and professionally to carry out a life long dream of helping people learn how to take responsibility for their own health. As a result of nutritional counseling and self-care skills learned in my practice, many patients have become so healthy that I was able to transition my ""sickness-based"" practice to a ""wellness practice"" and built a brand new office in Lake Town Center in Mount Dora in January of 2008. 
As a Nurse Practitioner, I have the opportunity to teach, encourage, motivate and engage others in taking responsibility for their own health. My approach is holistic and encompasses mind, body and spirit. I find nothing more rewarding than to be part of the process that unfolds when a person decides to take personal responsibility for their own health and makes changes to improve the quality of their life because of something that I might have said, explained, described or recommended. 
From a patients’ perspective, a visit to a Nurse Practitioner can be a new and exciting experience. The primary focus of care is based on health maintenance and prevention of health problems. A Nurse Practitioner can offer you the benefit of years of experience as a Registered Nurse, which includes effective communication between patient and provider as the primary goal. Nurses are experienced at listening to patients concerns, explaining in detail what is happening with their health, alleviating fears and teaching people how to take better care of their mind, body and spirit.

Whitfield, MD, brings more than three decades of exceptional gynecological healthcare training and experience to women in the Fort Worth, Texas area.
After graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas City I relocated to Dallas for a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Parkland Memorial Hospital.  I loved this area, so decided to start my practice in Fort Worth.  What I found were a wonderful a medical community, patients, and colleagues which helped build a thriving practice. Over the years, I have strived to provide compassionate and expert care in a professional and friendly environment.  Practicing obstetrics has been a wonderful opportunity to participate in building families that make up our community.  And gynecology has allowed me to provide care to thousands of DFW women from the teens, through the reproductive years and into menopause.
Modern women’s healthcare means options and choices. And as medical science develops, so do treatment options. I have strived to stay abreast of the latest developments and have continued to position myself as one who can offer contemporary treatments to my patients. Obstetrics and Gynecology is a very diverse specialty and staying current with developments in essentially two specialties has become a challenge within my specialty. So, after delivering over 2000 babies to area families, I decided to pursue an ongoing passion and focus my practice exclusively on gynecology and gynecologic surgery.
What I have found is that more and more women are, in fact, choosing to see someone who specializes exclusively in gynecology and the reasons are many. Your time is important, you are looking for someone who specializes in the problems that pertain to you, and you are looking for a higher level of service and care. My staff has been carefully chosen as professional, friendly and helpful individuals who have been thoroughly trained in gynecology to provide expert care in a warm and compassionate setting. We are not just interested in outcomes, but also in you as a person and your story. Furthermore, providing a high level of service exceeding your expectations is our goal.
My team and I look forward to meeting you and taking care of your needs. We are excited about the possibility of creating a trusting and caring healthcare partnership with you.

“When I raised my testosterone level from 440 to 1500, I felt like I was 25 years old again. Increased energy, improved sleep patterns, less anxiety, increased strength, loss of fat, increased muscle mass, increased mental clarity and more. My family and friends are all on BioTE hormone replacement therapy. They all have had similar results. Try it once and see for yourself. I am keeping my testosterone at 1500 from now on.”  Dr. Smyer

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans’ clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. 
After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. 
After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. 
My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.
In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.
I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the body’s inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients,’ and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.

Her additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy from the Academy of Anti-Aging has allowed her the tools to provide patients with solutions to their health concerns. Doctor Taylor feels that the patient is her best source of information and by listening to her patients and connecting with them through a one hour initial appointment, she can gain all the information needed to develop a customized treatment plan.
Pasadena Bioidentical Hormones Doctor Julie Taylor’s passion is to help women and men live better, to feel whole, and to be at their best to keep up with all the juggling we do in our every day lives. “With the chronic stress many people are under whether it’s fighting traffic, answering phone calls, dealing with home life stressors, not getting enough sleep and exercise, and even traveling on the plane frequently enough, our hormones can quickly become out of balance. Furthermore, we are exposed to a lot of toxins in our environment through the food we eat and air we breathe that can also wreak havoc on our hormonal balance. In addition, every time a woman has a baby, her hormones reset themselves, which could be balanced or unbalanced. When our hormones become disrupted, every part of our body is affected, from our quality of sleep, to our eating habits, our sex life, our propensity to disease, and the way we look and feel about ourselves. If your hormones are out of balance, getting them in balance can make you feel like a new you!”
Julie Taylor M.D. was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. She received her medical degree from Michigan State University and completed her MPH and residency training in preventive medicine at Loma Linda University, where she focused much of her training on bioidentical hormone replacement. She went on to complete additional training in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy through the American Academy of Anti aging. She treats patients at her Sierra Madre, California clinic and focuses on preventive medicine, lifestyle medicine, chronic disease reversal,, and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. During the first visit, Doctor Taylor spends a full hour with each new patient, listening to their needs and health goals and develops a tailor-made plan based on each patient’s goals. Once each patient is well on his or her way to balanced hormones, Doctor Taylor conducts periodic tests to make sure this optimal balance is sustained.

She graduated with her MD from Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio and completed her residency at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois.
 
Dr. Karen Kaufman - Passion for Functional Medicine
While practicing in Boulder, Dr. Kaufman became aware that patients needed and wanted more than what they were receiving from traditional Western Medical healthcare. She observed that while some patients felt better with certain medications including bio-identical hormones, a large percentage continued to not feel “well” or had even more symptoms because underlying issues were not addressed. Through these observations she became passionate about functional, integrative medical care and incorporating more holistic approaches with patients. As a result, she pursued a fellowship in Functional Medicine to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying triggers that keep patients from experiencing their optimal health.
 
More Time for Personalized and Comprehensive Care
Dr. Kaufman recognized that she wanted to take more time to investigate and understand the various underlying causes of her patient's symptoms than she had in a traditional medical model. Her current practice, Kaufman Health and Hormone Center reflects a personalized and comprehensive care model emphasizing the partnership between doctor and patient.
Partnering With Patients
Each patient is an individual with varying backgrounds, life stressors, medical history and symptoms. Dr. Kaufman takes the time to learn about and partner with each patient to provide more personalized and comprehensive health care to help someone feel better when out of balance.
Mission Driven
Dr. Kaufman's mission is to provide personalized and comprehensive health care to patients using both conventional medicine combined with her functional medicine training. Her focus is in adolescent gynecology, peri-menopause, menopause and hormone changes throughout every decade of life.

This therapy helps patients feel much better and reduces or eliminates many of the annoying symptoms patients feel as the aging process occurs. It also helps provide many long term health benefits that are documented in scientific literature.

He did his undergraduate study, medical school and Family Practice Residency at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He and his family moved back to Wylie in 1985 after becoming board certified in Family Practice. He joined his father, Terrill M Trimble, MD’s practice and they worked together until 1998.  He then joined the Family Medical Center of Tulsa medical staff and was an attending physician with the In His Image Family Practice Residency out of Hillcrest Medical Center for the next four years. He and his family returned to East Texas in 2002, moving to Pittsburg, Texas to work with East Texas Medical Center. In 2007 he gave up his clinic practice and became a full time hospitalist with the ETMC Pittsburg Critical Access Hospital. March, 2012, he joined the medical staff at the Linden Good Shepherd Medical Center (GSMC) and resumed a full Family Practice with Good Shepherd Medical Associates (GSMA), caring for both clinic and hospitalized patients. 
PhyNet, a non-profit healthcare corporation took over management of the Linden GSMA clinic when GSMA closed the Linden hospital.
Dr. Trimble has enjoyed being a part of PhyNet’s network of primary care clinics that are “committed to providing advanced medical technology in coordinated services, focusing on personal care, patients’ total wellness, with quicker and easier access in underserved neighborhoods.”
He became interested in functional medicine in 2012 after realizing the failure of current medical care: typically a doctor moving from patient to patient writing multiple prescriptions, “a pill for every ill” and “a drug for every bug,” with the goal of seeing as many patients as possible.
In general, medical doctors diagnose and manage disease; where functional medicine seeks to addresses the underlying causes of disease, engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. Dr. Trimble is working to shift the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach. He would like to recapture the essence of being a doctor, which originates from the Latin verb doc?re 'to teach'. 
Training and certification in BioTE has been refreshing for Dr. Trimble’s practice of medicine. He is realizing his desire to practice functional medicine. He now can assist his patients to create health by providing care that restores the necessary components needed by the body to age in health. It is his desire for people to stay healthy and active for the rest of their life.

He then attended medical school at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Dr. Watson graduated in 1988, having received the Elvin Shuffield Award in Excellence. In 1992 he completed his internship and residency at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver, Colorado.  His private practice career started in this very office with his first partner Dr. David Ricca until Dr. Ricca's untimely death in 1996. Dr. Bruce Dorr then joined him in 1997. That spirit of partnership continues to thrive today, not only between Dr. Watson and the office staff, but with his patients as well. Many patients actively share in their care as a result. Dr. Watson certified in performing robotic surgery with the DaVinci method.

Dr. Watson was married in 1988 and now has two boys, JJ and Jake. His family is the most important aspect of his life and he considers his office staff as part of that family (for which we are all grateful!) That spirit is exemplified in the interactions between the staff and the patients. He thoroughly enjoys all that Colorado has to offer. Dr. Watson is an avid bicyclist and skier and he has formally logged over one million vertical feet of heli-skiing!  Welcome!

Personal message from Dr. Watson…
I have been an OB/GYN for over twenty-five years and have promoted healthy lifestyles with diet and exercise as part of my practice. My mantra has always been “It’s not what you could do, it’s not what you can do, but what you will do when you are 90.”  However, I found that something was missing, that eating well and activity were not enough. We have struggled with traditional forms of hormone treatments and doing what we were told, but this wasn’t working either. It was through a series of these frustrations that I happened upon BioTE Medical. I am excited to be finally able to offer something to my patients (and their husbands!) that can bring back that spark in life. I have promoted “bioidenticals” for a long time, but the delivery mechanisms and often the products were substandard.  I feel we now have both issues addressed so we can achieve that Right Balance.

A true Kansas native, he attended elementary school, middle school and high school all in Kansas. When he graduated from high school in 1966 he attended undergraduate college in Anderson, Indiana at Anderson University, graduating in 1970. He continued his education at Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences and graduated in 1975 with his medical degree in Osteopathic Medicine.
Merle decided at a young age to become a doctor – though it was through tragic circumstances. While in the second grade, he discovered a young mother next door, who lived in his same neighborhood, had taken her own life. The thought entered his mind, “If I had known what to do I could have saved her.” Through this neighborhood tragedy, Merle Turner was determined to one day become Dr. Turner so that he could help people through the various stages of mental and physical health.
For Dr. Turner, patient care takes many forms, however, he is particularly passionate about the practice of preventative care. Though his passion for preventative care is all-encompassing, he sums it up with the simple philosophy of, “Preventing a problem is better than trying to cure a problem.”","mturner@warnerfamilypractice.net","480-752-7600","5d0d286ebe5127cd","2310","1227","2016-10-15","0","1","1","jnewell@warnerfamilypractice.net"

Although it may seem like she was a city girl, Dr. McConnell grew up on a farm. In fact, her medical experience began on her family’s farm with the medical care of her animals.
“I passed out cold the first time I saw my Dad give our cat vaccinations.”
This experience allowed Dr. McConnell to realize that she wanted to help people. It was as a teenager that she got interested in science and worked as a veterinary technician. The fascination of science, nature and the human body and how perfectly orchestrated it all is was the reason she chose the medical field.
Practicing medicine has many rewards as Dr. McConnell will tell you.
“Making the patient feel better when they are certain they won’t. Giving back a quality life so they can follow their bliss, which is the purpose of our lives.”
Dr. McConnell, just like the rest of the Warner Family Practice staff, knows the importance of preventative care. When you put an emphasis on preventative care, it offers a longer, higher quality life and empowers a person to pursue what matters in their life.
For Dr. McConnell, practicing medicine is more than her job, it’s about improving and fostering human connections. Deeper human connections teach us about life, love and ourselves.
“My goal is honest, genuine connections with people everyday.”
When you build these relationships with the patient, you are able to speak truthfully about all your past health choices, no matter what they are. Dr. McConnell will tell all her patients, “that was you then, you are not that person now.” The past is a lesson to learn and improve on. It’s knowledge just like anything else. Focusing on the future and not your past is when you move forward.
Outside the office, making time for herself is Dr. McConnell’s top priority. That one aspect is different from day-to-day.

Growing up, Paul would spend time with his father, a physician, making rounds at the hospital. It was during this time that he first displayed an interest in working in medicine. In 1999, Paul went on to earn his Bachelor of Medical Science from Midwestern University.
As a child and even into adulthood, Paul’s parents stressed and impressed upon him the need to be helpful to other people. Both of his parents were in healthcare and, to Paul, entering the same field seemed to be the best way to serve others. In 2004, Paul followed in the footsteps of his parents and earned his Master of Science from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine.
“Medicine has been so rewarding because I’ve been able to see patients utilize health screenings and preventative medicine to improve their overall health and well-being.”
Because he realizes the benefits of treating patients with a preventative medicine mind set, Paul looks for the most medically appropriate and patient-centric preventative methods to help them prevent potential conditions or delay conditions which may be inevitable. Ultimately it’s about helping patients be at their best, day in and day out.
“Success is seeing patients feel better physically. Success is witnessing the changes they make in their lifestyles to improve their health.”
When patients visit with Paul, he knows each one comes from a unique health background, having made a variety of good or bad health choices. No matter the consequences of those choices, he sees “now” as the best possible time to start making new life decisions for the benefit of the patient’s health.
Paul lives in Gilbert with his wife, Beth. Together they enjoy exercising, listening to music and traveling. They also enjoy attending their local church together.
When Paul has free time, he often enjoys it fishing lakeside or shooting sporting clays (target shooting) outdoors.
What Paul Wants You to Know About Him
“I like to share my own experiences with my patients in the arenas of disease screening, prevention and health improvement. I’m a human being, just like everyone else.”

Growing up, she was involved in many after school activities, including gymnastics, theater, speech and the debate club. This love of activities has been passed on to her children, who also are involved in sports and theater arts.
After graduating from high school, Stephanie attended Arizona State University. At first, she declared her major as Psychology, but it was not soon after that she decided to change it to the medical field. The opportunity for lifelong learning where she could make a difference in other people’s lives was too difficult for her to pass up and she has not looked back.
“The most rewarding part of practicing medicine is the ability to help others.”
Stephanie, just like the rest of Warner Family Practice, knows the value of placing an emphasis on preventative care. She wants to give the patient the power to control their outcomes to positively impact their health.
It’s this journey that brings joy to Stephanie. Everybody comes with different situations, some good and some bad. Bad choices may have been made in the past; when you focus on what you can do now, you can overcome these struggles and move forward.
“When I see a patient in a follow-up and they are feeling better, their labs are better or they overcome their obstacle in their journey to health, that’s what I define as success.”

There he continued his education enrolling at the University of San Diego and in 1998 earned his Bachelor of Science in Biology with emphasis on Cellular and Molecular Biology.
Early on in elementary school, Neil realized he wanted to work in the health industry. As a child, he often spent time in the hospital for respiratory difficulties as well as sports injuries. After graduating from San Diego State University, he was accepted into the Ross University School of Medicine and in 2004 earned his Medical Degree fulfilling his childhood desire to become a health practitioner.
“The most rewarding part of practicing medicine is knowing that I am helping to improve outcomes of not only individual patients, but across entire families.”
When it comes to caring for patients, Dr. Sheth places great emphasis on preventative care. He sees the active practice of preventative care as a way to diagnose problems early and make necessary changes. These changes help his patients prevent diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and strokes.
“I approach every patient with an open mind and will do my best to help improve their health. As one of my patients has said, ‘there is no shame or secrets in your exam room.’”
Dr. Sheth is multilingual speaking Gujarati and Spanish. His favorite pastimes are sports (basketball and football), enjoying outdoor life, hiking and golfing.
Prior to having children, Dr. Sheth and his wife traveled the world together. Since having children, he places high priority on simply spending time with family.

Darryl D. Robinson, M.D. was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Magnum Cum Laude in 1991. He then went on to the Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia where he was awarded both the Alumni and Health Professional Scholarships, graduating in 1995.

In 1995 Dr. Robinson was commissioned as a Captain into the United States Army and completed an Internship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 1996. From 1996 through 1998 he worked as a General Medical Officer at Winn Army Community Hospital, Fort Stewart, Georgia. He resigned his active duty commission in 1998 and continued in the individual ready reserves through 2004.

Dr. Robinson completed a Residency in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, North Carolina in 2001. From 2001 through 2002 he completed a sub-specialty Fellowship in Pain Medicine via Baylor University – Saint Anthony North Ambulatory Surgery Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Dr. Robinson became a member of Oklahoma Sports Science and Orthopedics in 2002 and is Board Certified by the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation with a sub-specialty in Pain Medicine.

After more than a decade of providing comprehensive, state of the art treatment for pain syndromes, Dr Robinson in 2012 was acknowledged by Castle Connolly as one of the region’s top physicians. One thing that has become apparent is that pain programs that rely primarily on conventional pharmaceutical medications are limited. For this reason Dr. Robinson began to search for treatment alternatives that would expand his comprehensive approach and improve clinical outcomes. This approach focuses on optimizing the body’s natural functional and restorative capacity via the tenants of nutrition, hormone optimization, and wellness.

In pursuit of the most heavily researched and vetted approaches, he became a Certified Fellow and Board Certified by the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine. These concepts have served as his inspiration as medical director of Longevity Health, Beauty, and Wellness. In 2012 Dr. Robinson was also selected into the inaugural class of “Pink Tie Guys” by the Susan G. Komen affiliate in Central and Western Oklahoma to serve as an ambassador for women’s health in the fight against breast cancer.","","","f6f6f76bc07a5dea","364","210","2013-09-14","0","1","1","riannas@okss.com;tturbyfill@okss.com"

After the Women’s Health Initiative Trial in 2002 revealed that synthetic hormones could increase women’s risk of breast cancer, heart attack, stroke, blood clots and Alzheimer’s disease, Carolyn decided to devote her studies to Bio-Identical Hormones. She wanted to learn how to prescribe them safely and effectively. Carolyn has traveled throughout the United States and has studied under the most prominent experts in Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) — Dr. Sangeeta Pati in Orlando, Dr. Neil Rouzier in Salt Lake City, Dr. Daved Rosensweet in Naples, Florida and Dr. Gary Donovitz in Dallas. She is knowledgeable of all the delivery methods of hormone replacement and is especially excited and satisfied with the BioTE pelleting system.
Carolyn was the first BioTE Medical Certified Practitioner in Florida and was recently invited to become Faculty for BioTE Medical — providing BHRT training on the national level to physicians and Nurse Practitioners.
As a proud member of the Forever Health Practitioner Network, whose national spokesperson is Suzanne Somers; Carolyn has worked with Suzanne on several projects. Carolyn and Suzanne have a great rapport and are like-minded in their beliefs of healthy aging and BHRT.
Carolyn has dedicated her practice to BHRT to men and women, but also provides office gynecology and cosmetic injections at her Fort Lauderdale office.

Dr. Bauer embraced helping women figure out their menstrual cycles and helping them as they worked through infertility. After a four-year residency in Buffalo, New York, Dr. Bauer accepted a position in a hospital based OB/GYN practice in Northern Minnesota for three years prior to coming to Colorado.
Dr. Bauer was drawn to be a prolife physician as a teenager when her primary care doctor thought it was her obligation to council her about safe sex and being on birth control. It was frustrating for her and her mother when they assured the doctor she was committed to abstinence until marriage and the doctor told them all teenagers are sexually active. Dr. Bauer then met a wonderful family physician who encouraged abstinence until marriage and believed in them and their commitment to wait for marriage. It was so refreshing to have such a great doctor. This physician then invited her shadow her at a prolife clinic and Dr. Bauer witnessed the compassionate care to women from all walks of life that she herself desired as a physician.
Dr. Bauer and her husband, Jordan, are originally from Minnesota. They have three children: Seamus, Virginia and Danika.

Sherri Newman, is a Board Certified Family Nurse Practitioner who has been practicing in Bowling Green, KY since 2010.  After graduating from WKU in 1994 with her BSN, she worked in the CCU setting for 4 years.  In 1998 she transitioned to the area of Health and Wellness.  Sherri saw the need for practitioners in Preventive and Anti-Aging care and decided to return to school to pursue a degree as a FNP.  Mrs. Newman began her career practicing part-time in a thriving weight loss clinic alongside Dr. Richard Welch.  After practicing for 2 years she realized that there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise.  Experiencing hormone related changes herself she began researching hormone replacement therapy and the role hormones play in not only weight loss but also one’s well-being.  Sherri knew this was the career path she wanted to continue after experiencing such positive results with her own hormone replacement therapy.

*Employed as a registered nurse for 20+ years prior to obtaining NP degree. I had mainly worked in specialty areas i.e. newborn ICU, operating room, 
recovery room, emergency room.
 
My thesis was on exploring hormonal changes during menopause. 
“Sexual Dysfunction and Management Issues in the Aging Woman.” 
I have been interested in hormones and their function in the body for many years. I feel this is an area lacking in the medical field. I feel the medical community at large know very little about the thyroid gland and the brain. These two amazing organs are so complex and drive many or all of the functions in the human body. The information given me in NP school about the thyroid gland and how to manage it was so elementary.  I have since taken the initiative to study and learn all I can about the thyroid and sex hormones so I can help my patients have a higher quality of life. I have seen bio-identical hormones make a huge difference in how my patients feel and embrace life. Improving the quality of life in my patients is so enriching to me. Improving the quality of my own life with bio-identical hormone has been such a positive journey.
Preventative health makes so much more sense than fixing what’s broken. 
I know the path I have chosen is where I need to be. I know bio-identical hormone ","deetsl@yahoo.com","801-393-3586","f193253071e608ec","4139","2123","2018-03-24","0","1","1","mwlutah@aol.com"

He is a graduate of Cornell University and Cornell Medical School and completed his residency in Emergency Medicine at LA County/USC Medical Center.  Dr. Dean has over 30 years of experience in medicine including emergency medicine in Los Angeles, Miami and the Florida Keys. He directed a busy urgent care and traveler’s clinic for 15 years before pursuing his passion in preventative medicine and healthy aging.   In addition to Bio Identical Hormone optimization, his special interests include medically assisted rapid weight loss, early detection and reduction of common health risks and nutritional assessment and optimization.  Dr. Dean refers to this as Preventative Emergency Medicine.  He likens this treatment form to helping prevent the CRASH rather than trying to put the broken pieces back together after the WRECK.  Healthy aging is simple; however, it is a personal decision.  If you are interested in improving your overall health and your life, Dr. Dean is here to help.  It is amazing and rewarding to see how much better people feel and function, on all levels, when their hormones are optimized and balanced.  It puts life into their years.

After medical school, she did 39 months of general surgery residency at Hennepin County medical center in Minneapolis and then did 24 months of anesthesia residency at Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota. She is board-certified in anesthesia.   In addition to managing patients in the intensive care unit, she has also taken care of patients in her pain management clinic and in her preoperative clinic. This experience has made her realize that many of the very seriously ill people that she cared for would not have been in that situation if they had made different choices in their lives.
Over 20 years ago during a lecture at an anesthesia meeting she was introduced to the concept of preventive aging. The speaker presented peer-reviewed studies that demonstrated slowing of the aging process and even some reversal by doing certain things. Since that time she has practiced his recommendations and continued to follow the literature and change her behavior accordingly. 
During these last 20+ years, this information has become more mainstream and people are out there searching for the secret to living longer and living better. In spite of this, the general health of the population has become significantly worse and for the first time in recorded history the next generation may live for a shorter period of time than the previous generation. 
About 2 1/2 years ago she was given the opportunity to start practicing a form of medicine to help people understand their individual risk factors for disease and guide them through a plan to prevent these diseases from affecting their future.
Recently she has opened a new office focusing on men’s health, and of course, bio-identical hormone replacement therapy.

In his search for answers, Dr. Zayed began consulting with a fellow physician and expert in the field of anti-aging. This introduced Dr. Zayed to anti-aging supplements, which produced an immediate and dramatic improvement in his father’s health.  He realized that there is a lot to be done to help patients from a preventative and functional approach, rather than the conventional approach geared towards symptomatic treatment as opposed to preventing disease. As a result of this experience, Dr. Zayed began to absorb everything he could find about anti-aging medicine. Now, years later, Dr. Zayed's Regenerative Medicine has become a leading Miami anti-aging medical clinic.
Dr. Zayed was born in Alexandria Egypt where he earned a British High School Diploma from an international school. He received his medical degree from the Alexandria Faculty of Medicine. From there he moved to the United States where he received his double Board Certification in Anesthesiology and Echocardiography. Dr. Zayed practiced Anesthesiology for several years before dedicating to Regenerative Medicine.
The Zayed Regenerative Medicine approach involves:
•	Compassionate, personalized, integrative and preventative care
•	Cutting-edge, evidence-based medical knowledge and technology
•	Supplements to reinforce and/or replace lost nutrients and hormones
•	Legal performance enhancing supplements for athletes who require the replacement of essential nutrients and hormones lost during intense training
Dr. Zayed was also the Chairman of The Young Philanthropists of Baptist Health. He believes that everyone should give back to their communities. Dr. Zayed also holds a position as a voluntary Assistant Professor at the Florida International University Medical School where he shares his experience and expertise with young future physicians.
*This is not accredited by the American Board of Medical Specialties. Mr. Zayed's Regenerative Medicine approach involves a compassionate, personalized, integrative and preventative care; cutting edge, evidence-based medical knowledge and technology; supplements to reinforce and/or replace lost nutrients and hormones.

Jay was born and raised in Southeast Texas where he discovered his love for helping others early in life.  In 1992, while in high school he completed an Emergency Medical Technician course and began working as an EMT with the local Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in the community where he was raised. While attending college, he continued serving in EMS and became a licensed paramedic. After graduating from Lamar University with a bachelor’s degree in biology, Jay worked full-time as a paramedic. During his 12 years of working in EMS, Jay had the opportunity to serve with several EMS departments throughout the state of Texas and also spent many of those years working as a flight paramedic on EMS helicopters. The wealth of experience he gained and his passion for helping others in their time of greatest need inspired him to continue his education and become a registered nurse.   
Jay and his family moved to Longview, Texas in 2006 where he worked as a nurse for Longview Regional Medical Center in the Emergency Department. Jay graduated from Ball State University in 2011 with a master’s of nursing degree with specialization as a family nurse practitioner. After graduating, he worked as an emergency nurse practitioner alongside an amazing group of emergency medicine physicians.

My dream since I was a child was to be a doctor so I could help others. I did my undergraduate training in Monterrey, Nuevo León Mexico at Universidad de Monterrey where I earned my medical degree. After passing my boards to practice medicine in the United States, I completed my Residency training in family practice at The McAllen Family Practice Residency Program which is affiliated with UT Health Science Center at San Antonio.  Family Practice & Obstetrics is my passion and the residency program I completed provided excellent training in these two areas. I have been in practice now for aprox 13 years with my best friend as my partner and I wouldn't change a thing. I have been truly blessed to be able to do what I love surrounded by people who I care about and who share my same values. During the early part of my formation I started to develop an interest in Aesthetics and have had the privilege of opening a Medspa and dedicating some of my time to grow in this area as well. Recently my focus has been preventative medicine and focusing on helping my patients live healthier and happier lives. I was recently appointed as chairperson for the Preventative Medicine Committee at one of our local hospitals. Over the years I have seen the main aspects of life which influence our culture and our people and lead them to develop chronic illnesses. . I am currently studying to be a health coach since I would like to dedicate more time to helping people reach their goals in weight loss but most important help them live a more balanced life. I am very interested in hormone testing and natural hormone replacement with bio identical hormones through pellet therapy.
I commit to continue my endeavor of preventing illness through education, change in lifestyle, optimizing patients hormones and most important being there as support to my patients. I am very excited to be the first to bring BioTe medical to the Rio Grande Valley!

Dr. Lord has helped develop and implement the Nava Method™—Nava’s proprietary approach to total body wellness. He has also been instrumental in liaising with other expert practitioners to successfully implement Nava’s range of therapies, treatments, and products.

In his role at Nava, Dr. Lord is responsible for maintaining Nava’s innovation and for creating the best experience for clients by ensuring they have access to the newest and best advances in integrative wellness. He achieves this by identifying and developing strategic partnerships in the field, and acting as a facilitator between Nava and various providers.

Doug’s passion for health and wellness is evident in both the way he lives his life and in the way he practices medicine. He is eager to share his extensive medical knowledge and experience with other Nava Directors.

Since he was raised to value a healthy, active lifestyle and has always had a strong interest in medicine, it was only natural that Doug chose to become a doctor. After graduating from Loma Linda University Medical School in California, Doug completed his residency program at George Washington University in Washington D.C. Since then, he has acquired over 40 years practicing Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area where he also introduced the innovative concept of family-centered obstetrics. Over the course of his career, Doug has developed the reputation as a highly respected practitioner and an expert in cutting-edge surgical techniques. 

Along the way, Doug gained exposure to integrative medicine and realized how narrow and limited his view had been as a traditional doctor. Always taught to think outside the box, and with a natural instinct to question everything, Doug became interested in learning more about the field of integrative medicine. He pursued his interest, training at the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine, and went on to study integrative medicine at the Sajune Institute of Regenerative and Restorative Medicine in Orlando, FL. 

Passionate about learning, teaching, and helping people, Doug is very involved in using scientific methods to help individuals lead healthy lives. He is excited about the opportunities for wellness and the extended resources that Nava offers its clients. 

In order to balance out his busy career, Doug maintains an active, healthy lifestyle. He describes himself as an avid golfer and travels regularly with his family, taking adventurous trips around the world to see how the rest of the world lives.

Dr. Lord has helped develop and implement the Nava Method™—Nava’s proprietary approach to total body wellness. He has also been instrumental in liaising with other expert practitioners to successfully implement Nava’s range of therapies, treatments, and products.

In his role at Nava, Dr. Lord is responsible for maintaining Nava’s innovation and for creating the best experience for clients by ensuring they have access to the newest and best advances in integrative wellness. He achieves this by identifying and developing strategic partnerships in the field, and acting as a facilitator between Nava and various providers.

Doug’s passion for health and wellness is evident in both the way he lives his life and in the way he practices medicine. He is eager to share his extensive medical knowledge and experience with other Nava Directors.

Since he was raised to value a healthy, active lifestyle and has always had a strong interest in medicine, it was only natural that Doug chose to become a doctor. After graduating from Loma Linda University Medical School in California, Doug completed his residency program at George Washington University in Washington D.C. Since then, he has acquired over 40 years practicing Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area where he also introduced the innovative concept of family-centered obstetrics. Over the course of his career, Doug has developed the reputation as a highly respected practitioner and an expert in cutting-edge surgical techniques. 

Along the way, Doug gained exposure to integrative medicine and realized how narrow and limited his view had been as a traditional doctor. Always taught to think outside the box, and with a natural instinct to question everything, Doug became interested in learning more about the field of integrative medicine. He pursued his interest, training at the American Academy of Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine, and went on to study integrative medicine at the Sajune Institute of Regenerative and Restorative Medicine in Orlando, FL. 

Passionate about learning, teaching, and helping people, Doug is very involved in using scientific methods to help individuals lead healthy lives. He is excited about the opportunities for wellness and the extended resources that Nava offers its clients. 

In order to balance out his busy career, Doug maintains an active, healthy lifestyle. He describes himself as an avid golfer and travels regularly with his family, taking adventurous trips around the world to see how the rest of the world lives.

Topnotch Education & Training
In her youth, Dr. Nazarian was accepted by Harvard-Westlake for middle and high school, where she honed her academic and artistic skills. During this time, she was awarded a Bronfman Youth Fellowship in Israel where she received 6 weeks of leadership training. She attended Columbia University in New York and graduated with a BA in economics with a premedical concentration.

Dr. Nazarian earned a Masters in Medical Management (MMM) at USC’s Marshall School of Business during her research years as well.

Dr. Nazarian believes that being a physician is an honor and a privilege – a profession that cannot be without ethics. After all, a plastic surgeon must be a sound doctor first.

	I am a graduate of Duke University's Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner program.  I completed my degree in 2016 graduating with a 4.0 GPA. I have over 10 years of nursing experience in the inpatient setting.  A majority of my nursing career was spent in a level 1 surgical/trauma ICU where I cared for complex patients with multiple comorbidities. I decided to become a Nurse Practitioner so that I could focus on a more proactive and holistic approach to health.  I am committed to providing excellent evidence-based, comprehensive and individualized care to my patients. I feel privileged and grateful for the opportunity to serve my patients as their primary care provider.  
	On a personal note, I grew up in Saratoga, NY and moved to NC in 2011.  On my days off I enjoy spending time with my husband, son and 2 dogs.  I love exploring everything the area has to offer.

They had loss of memory and difficulty thinking at times.  They displayed irritability, anxiety, and depression-like symptoms.  They were having decreased loss of muscle strength with joint pain.  Along with these symptoms, they lacked sexual desire and performance.  I knew their hormones were to blame but the medicines offered by the conventional medical community had potential side effects or even caused heart attacks, stroke, DVT’s and cancer and I didn’t really see them as effective.
I searched for a long time to find the right solution that would be safe for my patients, be effective and reverse all the symptoms they were experiencing.  I found it in Bioidentical Hormone Therapy or BHRT for short.  These hormones, along with some supplements, allowed my patients to regain energy and muscle strength while feeling younger and happier.  They had increased mental clarity and ability to lose weight again.  It restored or increased their sex drive and performance while decreasing their joint and muscle pain.  It’s been a great experience and we are just starting out.  I can not wait to see what else happens.
Call to speak to a representative and see if Balanced Hormone therapy is Right for you.

Drost, MD, ND, FACS first realized his calling as a physician at the age of eleven before entering junior high. He was very taken by the lives and practices of several family physicians in the small town where he grew up in southern Nevada and was encouraged by his parents to pursue the medical profession. He attended the University of Wyoming on a varsity football scholarship, earning a BS in Zoology/Physiology (premed). He then attended and graduated from the University of Nevada, School of Medicine in 1985 and completed a general surgery residency and trauma fellowship at the University of South Florida in 1991.
Dr. Tom served four years as a surgeon for the U. S. Army as a Major where he served both abroad and, in the U.S., During this time he experienced the ins and outs of a public health system, based upon the model of disease prevention used to maintain the health of the troops and their families. He then entered the world of a private surgical practice in Las Vegas, Nevada. It took only four short and painful years for him to come to the conclusion that medicine, and the way it was being delivered, was not the same as it was during his boyhood years. He feels the overall health of our society is deteriorating into chronic illness, patient and physician satisfaction are at an all-time low, and many previously successful therapies for many illnesses are no longer working or effective. Dr. Tom decided he would find a better way to deliver health care or quit!
Dr. Tom left a successful surgical practice in Las Vegas to enroll at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washington, one of five accredited naturopathic universities in North America. While practicing general surgery with a Seattle group, he earned a post graduate degree in Naturopathic Medicine. Dr. Tom Drost is currently a licensed physician and board-certified surgeon in the state of Illinois practicing environmental medicine, men’s health, IV therapies and specializing in chronic conditions. His goal is to optimize and bring clients' health back into focus and helping them to live and experience a better quality of life. His practice of environmental medicine includes cleansing/detoxification, allergy elimination, and treating toxic exposures. He completed additional training in environmental medicine under one of the nation's leading experts, Dr. Walter Crinnion. Dr. Tom combines the principles of conventional medicine with naturopathic principles, using such modalities as botanical medicine, IV nutrition and chelation, nutritional supplementation and lifestyle modification. Dr. Tom has expanded his interest in men’s health by implementing a comprehensive men’s health program. Dr. Tom is a respected physician in his community and maintains open and cooperative relationships with other physicians and health professionals of all disciplines.

Practicing medicine since 1992
Dr. Arturo Portales trained at the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine graduating in 1989. After residency, he worked in emergency medicine for 15 years. He became board certified in emergency medicine in 1997. Despite working in a variety of emergency department settings, he did not find the work fulfilling because he felt that there had to be more than a “band aid” approach to helping people fight disease. What Dr. Portales found in practice was that conventional medicine is disease oriented but fails to address the underlying issues of the individual. He also found that a patient’s lifestyle and nutrition were seldom if ever addressed. In the acute care setting, this approach saves lives. However, in the chronic care setting, this approach fails miserably. Chronic disease represents 78% of the total healthcare expenditures in the U.S and despite the billions spent, people are not any healthier.
Dr. Portales has since sought out other methods to deliver quality healthcare to patients where the root causes are addressed. What he learned through many hours of study is that diseases are multi-factorial and healthcare must be approached with an open mind. This means integrating other methods of healthcare delivery with an ultimate goal of optimizing a patient’s health. He found that each patient represents a unique set of circumstances and this necessitates an individualized approach to each and every patient.
Dr. Portales’ approach involves complete hormonal evaluations including testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone. He also assesses thyroid function and adrenal function. Other issues assessed include nutritional status, overall toxic load, emotional stressors, and gut function.
Dr. Portales is Board Certified by the American Academy of Anti-aging Medicine in Anti-Aging, Regenerative, and Functional Medicine. He completed his Fellowship training in Anti-aging, Regenerative, and Functional Medicine in 2011 (FAARM). He continues to pursue a Masters in Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine at the University Of South Florida College Of Medicine.
Last  year, Dr. Arturo Portales also won the www.vitals.com Patient’s Choice Award and the Compassionate Doctor Recognition award .

He is a graduate of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and completed his residency in Family Medicine and fellowship in Sport Medicine at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center. Since graduating in 1999, Dr. Sunshine has been practicing both Family Medicine and Sports Medicine and is board certified in both specialties.
Like many other physicians, Dr. Sunshine went into medicine to help others. His father is a physician and still loves going into work everyday. His father inspired him to pursue a similar career path and work ethic. During the past 15 years, Dr. Sunshine has established a fulfilling career cultivating personal relationships with patients and their families.
About My Medical Practice
As a physician, he makes it a point to connect with his patients and heartily encourage them to live a healthier life. Not only does he appreciate solving clinical problems but finds it rewarding to help patients create lifestyle changes that improve their well-being. Many of his patients are able to achieve health goals simply through regular exercise and sensible, consistent nutrition.
Dr. Sunshine strives to be a resource and an inspiration to my patients. He lives a lifestyle that he preaches daily to his patients. Hippocrates was quoted as saying, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy food.” Dr. Sunshine believes we can improve our health simply by living a healthier lifestyle through proper nutrition and regular exercise.
Our health is our number one asset. He emphasizes this point to his patients and helps them understand that prevention of illness is more important, cost-effective and rewarding than treating disease. He believes that the four pillars of good health are proper sleep, stress reduction, daily exercise and proper nutrition.

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans’ clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. 
After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. 
After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. 
My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.
In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.
I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the body’s inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients,’ and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.

Prior to joining Optimal Health Associates in 2009, Tina worked ten years for a premier interventional pain management practice. Her empathy and understanding of patients’ needs is all too personal.
“In March of 2006, I was diagnosed with Stage IIB Hodgkin’s Lymphoma,” she recounts. “I was blessed to have access to wonderful medical care at every stage of my diagnosis and treatment. I cannot even imagine going through such a frightening and uncertain time without all the excellent physicians, nurses, and other medical staff I came into contact during that time.”
After six months of chemotherapy and two months of radiation treatment, Tina was cancer free. But she’d gained a lesson for her life’s work.
“My personal goal is to treat each of my patients with the same respect and compassion that I received and that they deserve. I want to provide each with guidance and understanding of their medical conditions.”
“Whether you are facing a life-threatening cancer, a life changing event such as menopause, a fertility issue, or you come in for a normal healthcare maintenance visit, I would like to help provide a calm, stable, and safe environment for you to discuss your concerns.”

""The excitement and diversity of obstetrics and gynecology is what attracted me to this specialty. I find it very rewarding to help my patients with their individual medical needs.

This can only be achieved if she understands the necessary information and has a mutually trusting relationship with her doctor.""

""The rewards of educating and caring for women of all ages are immense. It is a privilege to be part of that unforgettable moment in a woman’s life as she gives birth. The close relationships I have formed with many of my patients bring me great satisfaction. As we journey through life’s experiences together, it is gratifying to play a role in women’s healthcare. Being a mother and a wife helps me relate to many of the issues my patients face.""

He has a phrase he likes to share with surgery patients: “The decision is more important than the incision.”
While Dr. Duffner enjoys the complexities and technical aspects of spine surgery, he is most concerned with how the patient feels – how has the surgery positively impacted their life. To this end, he has extensive experience in patient outcome studies and has been instrumental in improving outcome tracking at ICON – proudly reporting five years of data meeting or exceeding national database benchmarks.
Dr. Duffner earned his Medical Degree from the University of Oklahoma. He served his residency in orthopedics at Texas A&M.

My interests have been in women’s health care and preventative medicine since becoming a licensed physician in 1992. After obtaining my medical degree from the University of Health Sciences, Kansas City, I completed the family medicine residency at Truman Medical Center in 1995, also in Kansas City. I have two daughters. Kristin lives in Denver and is studying to be a radiology technician, and Jennifer lives in California with her children Jack & Ella. If you ask me about my grandchildren you will get an earful!
After years of prescribing pills for fatigue, depression, insomnia, muscle aches and pains, night sweats, low libido, low energy and lack of mental focus I was excited to learn of a very successful alternative approach with BioTE. As we age, the natural hormones we have decline and we begin to predictably suffer from the results of this. After becoming certified in the BioTE Method of hormone replacement, I am now offering this therapy to my patients. The pellet method of hormone replacement has been used and studied for many decades and is a safe and effective treatment option for both women and men. The science and experience behind the BioTE Method offers a better quality of life for all who suffer from the above mentioned symptoms. I would be happy to discuss this with you to see if you would be a good candidate for this treatment option. A simple questionnaire and blood test is all that is needed to see if you would benefit from this therapy. I hope to see you soon!

My name is Dr. Rebecca Lee Perlow. To distinguish myself from my husband most patients call me Dr. Rebecca. This is pretty much my usual garb, exactly how you’ll see me in the office. I was an RN( Registered Nurse) graduate of Los Angeles County/ University of Southern California Nursing school and started my first job as an RN at Tarzana hospital on January 16, 1982.
I am proud to state I was a Labor & Delivery Nurse:) I worked nights and went to school by day to get my degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology from California State University Northridge in 1987. I attended Western University Health Sciences in Pomona to achieve my Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in 1993. Yes, Osteopaths do surgery and write prescriptions. I attended Kaiser Permanente on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California from 1993 to 1997.
I am board certified in Obstetrics & Gynecology from the American Congress of Obstetricians & Gynecologists. I remain a Fellow of the American Congress of Obstetrics & Gynecology which is what the FACOG behind my name stands for. I meet all the annual requirements to maintain certification ( called MOC) by the ACOG .
I am former Vice-Chief of Obstetrics & Gynecology at what is now Providence Tarzana Medical Center. I returned to my hospital in 1997 to join my husband in our private practice. It is the only hospital I have privileges for other than out patient surgery centers.
I absolutely love my job, it was worth every second of advanced education to be able to care of you all!
Dennis Leonard Perlow graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a Bachelors Degree in Psychology in 1959.

Through listening to the unique nature of each patient’s history, he can provide treatment choices which complement the particular lifestyle of that person.
In order to achieve optimum quality of life for the women for whom he cares, he is able to provide advanced surgical care for a variety of gynecologic problems such as abnormal bleeding and “falling” of pelvic organs. His experience allows him to practice not only routine and high risk obstetrics, but advanced laparoscopic surgery and management of complex medical and surgical problems. He is skilled in da Vinci robotic surgery and serves as a trainer for other physicians in this technique.
A passionate interest is specific testing for hormone deficiencies that may prevent women from living life to the fullest. “Many women feel fatigue, “mind fog”, poor sleeping and loss of sexual desire. This feeling can often be addressed by treating deficiencies of the ovaries, thyroid glands, and adrenal glands that occur with time.” Many women find return of vitality and sense of well-being from these treatments.
Dr. Fleming is a native Texan. He supported himself through college and medical school by working a variety of jobs including rancher, carpenter, and teacher. He began his training in general surgery but changed to obstetrics and gynecology when he realized this area was his true calling.
When not working, he enjoys sports, cooking, outdoor activities, and spending time with his wife, Jeanine, and their three daughters.

"Plastic Surgery Institute & Spa","","1702 Ohio Avenue","Lynn Haven","FL","32444","850-647-8825","","30.2326017","-85.6494907","Adil","Ceydeli","MD","After completing undergraduate and medical school, Dr. Ceydeli continued his medical training at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, where he obtained a Master of Science degree in Anatomy, Cell Biology & Injury Sciences. His extensive research on the basic science of cell biology and scarless wound healing won him numerous awards, including one from the American College of Surgeons and another from the Association for Academic Surgery. His graduation thesis was published in the prestigious medical journal, Shock. In addition to his basic science research, he completed a Clinical Trauma Fellowship at New Jersey Medical School under the supervision of Dr. John H. Siegel, a pioneer in Trauma Surgery in the United States.
Subsequently, he started his General Surgery training at New York Methodist Hospital, where he also served as a chief resident. During his General Surgery residency, his interest in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery grew. His creativity and surgical skills were recognized by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), and he was invited to present a novel aesthetic breast surgery procedure he invented at that society’s annual meeting when he was a third-year General Surgical resident. His contributions to Cosmetic Surgery were also recognized by the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and his paper received the Best Resident Paper of the Year award.
Upon completion of his General Surgery training, Dr. Ceydeli started his Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery residency at the Medical College of Georgia. He contributed numerous articles to the Plastic Surgery literature, continued to present his innovative techniques at national meetings, and continued to receive accolades during his Plastic Surgery training.
Dr. Ceydeli was selected by Consumers’ Research Council of America for inclusion in the “2007 Guide to America’s Top Plastic Surgeons” and has been honored in multiple editions of Who’s Who® in America, which named him one of the emerging leaders in Healthcare and Medicine. He is one of only a handful of plastic surgeons in Northwest Florida to be double board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Surgery.
After finishing his Plastic Surgery training, Dr. Ceydeli also completed a prestigious Aesthetic Fellowship in Honolulu, Hawaii with the legendary Dr. Robert Flowers. Dr. Ceydeli is one of the few Plastic Surgeons in the country to be accepted to this program. His fellowship in Hawaii mainly focused on Facial Aesthetic Surgery and Asian Plastic Surgery.
After completing this fellowship, Dr. Ceydeli settled in Panama City Beach, on Florida’s Emerald Coast. His double board certification in plastic surgery and his advanced cosmetic surgery training with Dr. Flowers have made him uniquely qualified to pioneer numerous innovative procedures, both invasive and non-invasive, since his move to Northwest Florida.
Working in concert with his mentor Dr. Flowers, Dr. Ceydeli invented the revolutionary “MAG-5” facial rejuvenation procedure, a breakthrough that changed the concept of aesthetic facial surgery the world over. They co-authored the landmark article about MAG-5 in the prestigious plastic surgery journal, Clinics in Plastic Surgery. They presented and taught this innovative technique at numerous national and international scientific meetings. Plastic surgeons from every corner of the globe flew in to watch and learn this technique.
When facial structures start migrating southward due to the effects of gravity and aging, the MAG-5 procedure relocates them to the north, for the most natural and long lasting results. This is in contrast to most other facial procedures, such as the facelift, which pulls the face to the east and west, instead of lifting it northward where it belongs. The term facelift is actually a misnomer. Since the incisions made for this procedure are next to the ears, the facelift technique can only pull the face towards to ears, which in most cases gives the face an unnatural, tight look and does not address aging-related changes around the eyes and brows, or the cheek tissue itself. MAG-5, on the other hand, lifts the eyebrows, rejuvenates the lower eyelids by restoring its youthful almond shape, and lifts all the cheek tissue (not the skin alone), returning it to its original location. And, unlike those of a facelift, the MAG-5 incisions are invisible. There are only two incisions, one on the hair-bearing scalp, and another tiny incision under the eyelid. There are no incisions and thus no scars in front of the ear. This novel MAG-5 concept provides natural and longer lasting results.
One of the other innovative techniques Dr. Ceydeli learned from his work with Dr. Flowers is “Valentine Mouth Rejuvenation.” Again, due to the effects of gravity and aging, the corners of the mouth turn downward, giving the face a sad, frowning look. Many physicians think that this problem can be corrected by injecting soft tissue fillers or doing fat transfers. However, without addressing the down-turned mouth corners, injections alone only make matters worse. Patients often end up with the swollen sausage lips and lack of lip definition we have become all too familiar with. Dr. Ceydeli addresses the aging mouth by lifting the corners of the lips with a heart-shaped design flap (a small office procedure performed under local anesthesia), which gives the face a happy, pleasant look. He uses soft tissue fillers not to enlarge the lips, but to redefine them. His advanced chemical peel technique and/or state-of-the-art laser treatment further eliminates wrinkles around the lips and improves skin texture around the mouth area. The entire procedure is performed in the office under local anesthesia and takes less than an hour, giving the lips and mouth region an instant aesthetic improvement with natural results. No unnaturally inflated sausage lips – guaranteed.
Dr. Ceydeli is the only plastic surgeon in the region performing liposuction-assisted short-scar breast lifts and reductions. Although he has made improvements to traditional breast lift/reduction techniques (inferior pedicle Wise-pattern breast lift/reduction) and published articles on the subject, he now exclusively uses the liposuction-assisted short scar-breast lift/reduction technique for all breast lift and reduction cases, no matter how big or sagging the breast. With this technique, he minimizes unsightly scars beneath the breast, and more importantly, sculpts a beautiful, round, uplifted breast with longer lasting results than traditional breast lift/reduction techniques.
Dr. Ceydeli’s tummy tucks (abdominoplasties) are also different from the rest. They are not simply removing excess skin and fat, but rather toning and sculpting the abdomen with a sexy waistline, creating a natural “innie” belly button, and placing the incisions low enough that scars are invisible even with the lowest-cut bikini bottom.
In addition to his innovative and unique approaches to face, breast, and body, Dr. Ceydeli established the first advanced follicular unit hair transplantation center in the region, resulting in numerous happy patients. The newest techniques in hair transplant require a team approach, and Dr. Ceydeli’s hair transplant center is staffed with some of the best Bosley-trained hair technicians in the country with many years of experience.
Despite his advanced surgical training and background, Dr. Ceydeli has pioneered some of the most advanced non-invasive skin rejuvenation techniques in Florida’s Panhandle. He adapted the “True Blood” skin rejuvenation technique to his practice. This technique uses the patient’s own blood to rejuvenate the skin. Platelet-rich plasma, or PRP rich in growth factors and stem cell markers is obtained from the patient’s blood and reinjected back under the skin, thus stimulating skin cells to repair and refresh themselves. Since the person’s own blood is used, this is an absolutely safe approach, and the device used to obtain the PRP is FDA-approved. Even though this innovative technique is popular in Europe and has been featured in the US media, Dr. Ceydeli is still the only physician in Northwest Florida and one of the very few in the entire state to offer this procedure. Dr. Ceydeli also has Northwest Florida’s most advanced Lumenis skin resurfacing laser. This unique fractional CO2 laser, unlike the Fraxel laser, has the advanced technology to treat deep acne and surgical scars by stimulating new collagen formation, along with its standard use for wrinkles and brown age spots on the skin.
These innovative procedures and techniques are only few of the many services offered here at Plastic Surgery Institute & Spa.

Janette is a Physician Assistant board certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants and a Fellow member of the American Academy of Physician Assistants. She graduated in 2013 from the George Washington University School of Medicine with a Master’s in Health Sciences and certificate in Physician Assistant studies.

Her career began in Emergency Medicine for the George Washington University Hospital where she worked for several years before transitioning to cosmetic dermatology and anti-aging with ProMD Health. 
As a member of ProMD Health, Janette focuses on helping patients look and feel their best through facial rejuvenation, hair restoration, skin treatments, and hormone optimization. She began practicing bio-identical hormone optimization and pellet therapy to help fight the metabolic and hormonal imbalances that come with aging and decrease ones quality of life. 
“My goal is to increase vitality and self-esteem in my patients. I think bio-identical hormone replacement and nutraceutical therapy is extremely beneficial to patients as it helps to decrease symptoms of menopause, decrease inflammation that can accelerate aging, increase energy, increase libido, and increase overall sense of wellbeing.”

Her commitment to being her best and providing the best is marked by over 10 years of serving women in the metro Atlanta area.

He began his career spending countless hours in intensive care units and emergency rooms. Cody gained specialty training in acute cardiac care, airway management, and shock trauma which prepared him for a 7-year long career as a flight nurse delivering high level care to patients in airplanes, and helicopters.
After spending several years treating some of the sickest patients, Cody realized he was simply treating symptoms of underlying disease and not the disease.  By the time a patient ended up in the back of Cody’s helicopter it was often too late for him to make a difference in that person’s health. He is now convinced that treating the entire body rather than certain parts is the only effective way to manage his patients.
Cody treats his patients with an integrative and functional philosophy grounded in a solid foundation of traditional medicine. He believes the only way to truly help someone is to first listen and know their story. His primary focus is disease prevention, hormone balance, anti-aging, mental health and empower patients to take control of their own bodies and well being.","sasehealth@gmail.com","801-528-5392","1a40dd7507361fc4","3808","1950","2017-12-09","0","1","1","sasehealth@gmail.com"

In 2003, Dr. Stradling formed Reliance Medical Group with Dr. Allen Hurt and opened their Occupational Medicine clinic on Butler Avenue, expanding to Urgent Care in 2003.  Dr. Stradling fractured his leg in 2014, and it wouldn't heal!  His orthopedist informed him that his Vitamin D level was low.  This led to intense study of body hormone and vitamin deficiencies.  Friends had told him about BioTE and what they could offer.  Dr. Stradling researched their products and philosophy, deciding he could provide a vital service for the community that was not currently available.  In March of 2015, San Juan Wellness Center was born, offering a wide array of hormone replacement and nutritional supplementation using the BioTE method and BioTE products.","","","4cc228bea02a8fe7","1048","574","2015-02-21","0","1","1","jholgate@reliancemedicalgroup.com;kstrad@sisna.com"

Chang is an interventional physiatrist subspecializing in wellness and the treatment of pain. He offers a variety of treatments for neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. He treats non-operative neck and low back pain, spasticity, myofascial pain, scoliosis/kyphosis, compression fractures, sciatica and neuropathic pain conditions.
Chang performs a multitude of interventional procedures in the neck and low back, as well as advanced procedures such as spinal cord stimulators and intrathecal drug delivery pumps. He is experienced in the use of regenerative therapies (plasma rich platelets, stem cells therapy) to treat osteoarthritis and chronic injuries. He is also trained in electromyography. His special clinical and research interests are neuropathic pain, spasticity, arthritis and spinal disorders.
Chang’s basic science research interests are in investigating the pain mechanisms of low back pain and sciatica.  Low back pain is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. A common cause of back pain is from degenerative disc disease, which may present with radicular pain. Currently, low back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease is not well characterized and imaging studies do not correlate with the extent of pathology. In addition, little is known about the mechanisms associated with the actual progression of degenerative disc disease and radicular pain. As a result, these patients have limited diagnosis and treatment options for their pain and disability.

I believe that medicine is most powerful and effective when practiced in a whole person approach.

I keep on getting the same question from everyone, “you went through medical school and residency, didn’t sleep for hours, had to move multiple times, had to learn all these diseases and drugs and after all of that you are turning your back on all your training to practice alternative medicine?” And my answer of course is “No!” I didn’t turn my back on conventional medicine. I just chose to not skip the ?rst step of any chronic disease management which involves the choices we make. There is nothing “alternative” about trying to better the way you live. 

I always loved natural medicine. I remember my father making humidi?ers with eucalyptus leafs whenever we had a cold. I was very disappointed that conventional training lacked training in topics like nutrition, stress management, exercise and botanical medicine. I now feel very fortunate and blessed to be able to practice what I love. To see people getting better, feeling stronger, and doing things they didn’t think they could, is extremely rewarding.

Dr. Hunsicker is highly skilled in the latest plastic surgery techniques and specializes in breast and body contouring surgeries. She is one of an elite few surgeons in the country to perform the direct-to-implant breast reconstruction technique, which offers women the opportunity to have their reconstruction performed at the time of mastectomy. This procedure reduces the number of surgeries necessary for full reconstruction after mastectomy surgery.
Dr. Lisa Hunsicker is a strong advocate for women’s health issues, and enjoys giving back to under-served communities. In addition to volunteering at health fairs, Tri for the Cure, Race for the Cure, and at other local events, she has traveled many times to countries like El Salvador and Peru to perform reconstructive surgery on children and adults.

Studies show that normal bone mass will increase while a person is being treated with bio-identical testosterone and estrogen.  Not only will they help the bones, but the bio-identical hormones protect the heart, brain, and breast.

Miranda entered the medical field at 17 years old when she moved to Norfolk, Virginia to obtain her Bachelor of Science in Nursing. While at Old Dominion University, she worked in the post doctorate biology department as an aide to Dr. James Swanson, one of the pioneering reproductive endocrinologist in the country. She also worked as a nurses aide and nanny. During those four years, she served on the board of the university’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity, was pre-med, and was in the pre-health club, an organization dedicated to help students  meet med school entry requirements. Miranda feels the emphasis put on research through the various outlets at ODU helped shape her medical future.  She graduated with honors. 

During her nine and half year nursing career, she has worked at Duke University Hospital in Chapel Hill on the specialty surgery unit, Crossgates River Oaks Hospital in Brandon, Mississippi as the charge nurse on the pediatric/burn unit, and at Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana as a labor and delivery nurse. 

Miranda relocated to Louisiana to complete her clinical for her midwifery certification. She obtained her Masters of Science in Nursing from Frontier Nursing University, the first nurse midwifery school in the country. Miranda started her doctorate program the same month she graduated with her MSN, also through Frontier Nursing University. That degree, a Doctorate of Nursing Practice, is the highest clinical practice nursing degree and as she explains it, means that it’s recipients are experts in translating research for other providers and patients alike. 

Professionally, Miranda boasts a 1.4% primary cesarean rate. She uses vitamin and micronutrient supplementation along with lifestyle modification, and traditional medicine when necessary, to improve underlying causes of illness, not to mask symptoms as conventional medicine does. As an APRN, she has worked at Mint Health in Baton Rouge, Women’s Clinic in Abbeville, and is currently practicing midwifery at the University of Arkansas Medical Services.  

Post graduation, Miranda has used her doctorate to create online modules for training U.S. Army physicians and APRNs, serve on policy review boards, and be a peer reviewer for scholarly publications. 

Miranda is married to Haled, a Baton Rouge Police Officer and co-owner/COO of Saleh Health Spa. They have two young boys, Logan and Duncan, and an adopted dog and cat. The family loves to spend time on their land and is (very) slowly trying to convert it to a personal sustainable living farm. Right now, the boys are mostly enjoying their zip line and mini rock climbing wall while mom and dad are focusing on the spa.

Greetings, my name is Dr. Jeremy La Motte. I was born and raised in South Orange County. 

I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.

For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. 

After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.

During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. 

During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patient’s specific needs. I am now a BioTE® Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.

Greetings, my name is Dr. Jeremy La Motte. I was born and raised in South Orange County. 

I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.

For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. 

After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.

During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. 

During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patient’s specific needs. I am now a BioTE® Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.

Greetings, my name is Dr. Jeremy La Motte. I was born and raised in South Orange County. 

I attended UCLA for my undergraduate training with a major in Physiological Sciences.

For medical school I attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, IL. This is also where I also met my lovely wife. We now have three energetic boys who keep us very busy. 

After medical school I did my post-graduate training at the In His Image Family Medicine Residency Program in Tulsa, OK. I am currently board certified in Family Medicine. After residency I gained invaluable experience working in the Emergency Department, teaching at the Family Medicine Residency Program, and volunteering on a mobile medical van for underserved areas in Tulsa.

During residency I had several opportunities to do medical relief work after the major earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami in Indonesia. This is where I developed a passion for International Medicine. In 2010 our family moved to Nepal where we lived and I worked at a mission hospital for 3 and a half years. 

During my training I learned the importance of preventative medicine and whole person care. My goal is to keep patients healthy and not wait until they get sick to manage their illness with medications. Since returning from Nepal I have been trained in Functional Medicine, which looks at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and chronic disease. It involves finding the root cause of illness instead of just treating the symptoms. Part of this is correcting hormone imbalances. One of the best ways to do this is through inserting hormone pellets that are dosed according to a patient’s specific needs. I am now a BioTE® Certified Practitioner practicing in San Clemente. I would be honored to partner with you on your path to wellness.

Dr. Tami Horner is dedicated to helping patients achieve optimal health through nutrition, lifestyle changes, hormone balance, and other preventive measures.
Having experienced the negative effects of hormonal imbalances and nutritional deficiencies herself, she is passionate about treating each patient as an individual and spending time educating patients about their health.
After completing her residency and a fellowship in Sports Medicine, she practiced conventional medicine for 5 years and realized that the majority of disease processes and diseases of aging had a root cause of poor diet, lack of exercise, overstress, nutritional deficiencies and hormone imbalances.
However, in the conventional medicine model, it is very difficult to adequately treat these root causes when you only have 10-15 min per patient.  Therefore, Dr. Horner joined Success by Design in order to focus on educating patients about proper diet and adequate nutrition, exercise, stress management and hormone balance.  Dr. Horner is compassionate as she knows from her own experience this journey can be a struggle.
Dr. Horner received board certification in Family Medicine in 2004. She went on to complete the requirements for fellowship training and board certification from the American Academy of Anti-Aging, Regenerative and Functional Medicine in 2013. She also has received specialized training and certification in aesthetic treatments including Botox/Dysport and Cosmetic Fillers.
[quote]Throughout my medical/professional career, I have accumulated several certificates and degrees, as well as numerous awards and recognitions.  But what I am most proud of in life is my role as a wife and a mother.  Having given birth to my sons in my late 30s, I was concerned about “keeping up” with two very active boys!  My passion for achieving optimal health is driven by my desire to enjoy my family as long as I can.  I don’t want to just watch my children and someday, grandchildren, grow up.  I want to be an active part of their lives! – Dr. Tami Horner[/quote]

She has worked in surgery and bariatrics, in both the office setting as well assisting in surgeries, for over 12 years. She also owned her own nutritional practice in Boulder for many years, counseling patients on healthy diet and disease management. But her main passion has always been in women’s health…

After graduating from Boston College in 1999 Summa Cum Laude, Allison moved to Boulder, CO. Her first job was at Wellspring for Woman, an amazing women’s practice that consisted of numerous Nurse Practitioners, alternative health providers and forward thinking Doctors. This began her love for comprehensive holistic women’s healthcare.  She was trained by some of the best healthcare workers in Colorado, which inspired her to get her Masters in Nutrition at CSU with honors and then become a Nurse Practitioner through Regis University, with honors.

Allison strives to create a partnership with you in order to optimize your health, hormones, and diet. She has been trained to listen to how the patient actually feels vs. what tons of expensive labs say that other providers tend to demand.  Some of the modalities Allison uses are bioidentical hormones, diet, exercise, supplements, and medications if needed.  She is also trained in Botox and fillers, and is a certified BioTE Provider. 

She has a passion for preventative medicine and helping women and men age gracefully. She looks forward to working with you in your healthcare journey.

She has worked in many different areas in nursing including critical care, oncology, various surgery settings, medical offices and clinical informatics.  Laura has worked as a patient care nurse and nursing supervisor.  She was a nurse manager for the third busiest hospital in the Houston area.
Having spent many long years in the allopathic “traditional” system of medicine and seeing so many unresolved cases, Laura believes in Optimal Health, Natural Choices and Natural Medicine.  To see the system fail in so many places, there had to be something more.  Instead of trying to treat the symptoms, what happened to finding out the cause and working in such a way to help the body heal?
Her desire to help patients improve their health and look at a more holistic approach to patient care, Laura returned to school and is now a certified adult primary care nurse practitioner.  A nurse practitioner plays an important role in helping patients with education, prevention of illness, and encouraging wellness.  Nurse practitioners use less drugs than medical doctors and provide high-quality cost-effective personalized healthcare by treating the “whole” person.  “I think of my role as a functional provider like that of an investigator…what is the cause.  I find it is rarely one thing going on.  I love the challenge, but most importantly, it is helping my patients get better.” While Laura can write prescriptions for pharmaceutical drugs, she will most often work with diet, life-style modifications, and nutraceuticals first.
Some of the services she provides include:
•	Hormone optimization for men and women
•	Wellness visits
•	Lab work, x-rays, and other diagnostic tests
•	Lyme disease management
•	Primary care
•	Gynecological exams (including pap smears)
•	Joint injections
•	Minor procedures

Geohagen has been a Physician Assistant since 2001. She is educated in multiple disciplines. In 1985, she obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Teacher Education majoring in Arts & Crafts and Mathematics from the University of the West Indies. With that Degree, she returned to her Alma Mater, St. Hilda’s High School in Brown’s Town Jamaica, where she taught Arts & Crafts for a year before she emigrated to the United States of America. After working in the United States for a few years, Madge decided to return to school to pursue another degree. She attended Essex County College where she majored in Biology and obtained her Associates Degree in the same. She then, went on to Rutgers University where she continued to pursue her course in Biology. She was awarded a Bachelor’s of Arts Degree in Biology in 1997. That same year, she was accepted in the joint program for Physician Assistants at the University of Medicine and Dentistry and Seton University. Her studies culminated in her receiving her Master’s Degree in Physician Assistants.
After graduation from both Universities, Madge was immediately employed by the St. Michael’s Medical Center in Newark New Jersey in the Vascular Surgery Department. She was given honor of being the Medical Coordinator for a 13-Million-dollar Clinical trial that was being conducted by one of the Doctors for whom she was employed. After working at St. Michael’s Medical Center for 4 years, Madge decided to relocate to the sunny Orlando Florida where she continued to work in Vascular Medicine at the Florida Hospital. With added experience, Madge decided to branch into Esthetic Medicine where she specializes in enhancing the beauty of her clients. Madge believes that if she can bring joy to her clients by the renewal of their confidence, then she would have done her divine purpose, a purpose to serve.
Madge has always had a passion for fashion since she was quite young. As a matter of fact, her relocation from Jamaica to the United States of America was due to her being accepted at The Fashion Institute in Manhattan New York to pursue a degree in Fashion Design. She was unable to pursue that degree due to financial restraints. However, in 2016 Madge decided that she would not give up on her passion and she, along with her husband, started on online clothing boutique whereby she is allowed to fulfill her deep-seated passion.

He attended Tulane University where he graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Dr. Payne went on to obtain his medical degree from Texas Tech University School of Medicine. He did his residency at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and has been in private practice there since 1984. Dr. Payne is board certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology and is an attending physician at Baylor University Medical Center as well as Baylor Medical Center of Frisco. While on staff at Baylor he has been named as outstanding teacher twice, and also has been named to Texas Monthly's Super Doctor list. His areas of interest include general obstetrics and gynecology, infertility, robotic surgery, high risk pregnancy, and menopause.

Dr. Payne's philosophy of medicine was formed by watching his father practice medicine as a small town general practitioner in west Texas. He believes the most important thing for a physician to do is to stop and listen to his patients. This philosophy allows him to correctly apply the science of medicine on an individual basis. In so doing the doctor patient relationship grows in trust and respect. This belief is reflected in his attitude to treat the entire patient viewing himself as a primary care doctor for women, following them from puberty, through childbearing years, and into and through menopause.

Her Master’s Degree in Nursing was from Indiana University for the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner program.  She subsequently received a Post-Master’s Certificate for the Family Nurse Practitioner program from the University of Indianapolis.  She has worked in Urgent Care, Occupational Health, Internal Medicine and Primary Care settings.

Over the years, she started believing there was something more beyond focusing on medications as the answer to each new symptom.  Instead of focusing on patching up symptoms as they occur, Deb finds much more success in searching for the root cause of those symptoms.  It is only when we discover the root cause that we can truly heal the body.  She uses her thorough discussions with her patients to truly understand them and their unique situations.  With that knowledge, she can then find the cause of the outward symptoms and work to resolve it, which often resolves the body’s distress and many other symptoms that may not have seemed related.

This focus on treating the whole person led Deb to focus more on a Functional approach to medical care.  We believe in Patient-Centered Care – where we bring the patient into the discovery process & tailor the treatment to the patient’s individual needs.

We believe in an Integrative, Science-based Healthcare Approach where we focus on the complex interactions in the patient’s individual history, physiology and lifestyle that can impact health & lead to illness.

We believe in Integrating Best Medical Practices – where we integrate traditional Western medicine practices with holistic treatments, creating a focus on prevention through nutrition, diet and exercise; using the latest lab and diagnostic testing, and combinations of appropriate prescribed medications when indicated, supplements, therapeutic diets, and stress-management techniques.","debnp@SHCOcala.com","352-629-5939","4e8851bc3bd0b8bd","1385","767","2015-08-22","0","0","0","chrissy@shcocala.com"

Synergy Integrative Medical Center

Dr. Rebecca Ryder is a board certified gynecologist, a member of the Institute for Functional Medicine, a member of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, and an expert in nutrition.

Dr. Ryder's medical degree and residency were completed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, where she also received her undergraduate degree in Nutrition.
She is a former faculty member at Duke University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, and has completed extensive training in medical acupuncture for physicians as well as herbal medicine.

Dr. Ryder was selected by her peers three years in a row as “TOP DOC” in her field.  The recognition came courtesy of a yearly Hampton Roads Magazine survey, which put Dr. Ryder atop her field from 2012 - 2014. 

Dr. Ryder blends the roles of traditional and holistic medicine. She is one of the few physicians in Hampton Roads who has completed the Institute for Functional Medicine's training program.  Functional Medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs.  By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach, Functional Medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional Medicine doctors spend time with their patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, Functional Medicine individualizes treating the patient.

She is well-versed in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, menopausal issues, and the treatment of many chronic medical conditions with acupuncture and herbal medicine.
Dr. Ryder is the mother of four boys, and enjoys reading, traveling, scrapbooking, yoga, and being a private pilot in her (limited) spare time.

Nurse Practitioner Kimberly Harris graduated from Binghamton University in New York with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and earned her Master’s degree from Old Dominion University in 1998. She became board certified as a Family Nurse Practitioner in 1999 and has been practicing for 16 years, 13 of those in gynecology.

Kim developed a special interest in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and female sexual health through her experience with women's health.

“I believe that women need a trusted source for information and advice as they enter the menopausal years,” says Kim. “The media bombards us with warnings and tidbits of information extracted from research studies without providing the full picture. Women are left scared to treat their menopausal symptoms and are uncertain where to turn for help.

“A lot of women also have some form of sexual dysfunction and have been unable to find solutions through traditional medicine. Many of them count on Synergy to be their source for information, advice, and solutions, and I am thrilled to now be able to help them too.""

Kim is married with two children, and enjoys sea glass art, photography and scrapbooking.

She has a special interest in advanced laparoscopy, cervical dysplasia, and minimally invasive surgery.

Dr. Leao earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia.  She then excelled at Eastern Virginia Medical School where she was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  Her training continued at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C., where she completed her internship and residency.

“As a gynecologist I am a teacher, a confidant, a problem solver, and a healer,” says Dr. Leao.  “I love improving the quality of life for thousands of women through behavioral, medical and surgical interventions.  It is immensely gratifying to cure disease and to alleviate symptoms for women throughout their pre, peri, and postmenopausal years.”

Dr. Leao says no question is too embarrassing to ask your gynecologist.  “We’re here to help and we’ve heard it all.”  

She advocates that:
•	Sex should be enjoyable and mutually fulfilling throughout your adult years.  
•	Your menstrual cycle should never dominate your days.  
•	Never ignore a breast lump.  One in eight women will develop breast cancer. 
•	Of all the gynecological cancers, cervical cancer has the highest incidence and mortality worldwide.  However, it is the lowest in this country due to pap smears.  Receive them at the recommended time interval, and always follow up on an abnormal pap smear. 

Dr. Leao is a native of Hampton Roads and has been serving the community in private practice for six years.  She is married and the proud mother of three boys.  In her spare time (when not participating in sports with her children), she enjoys reading.

In my youth I was often found helping with the births of kittens, puppies, and lambs.  I was fascinated with new life. I proceeded through nursing school at Salt Lake Community College and Brigham Young University-Idaho and began the path of helping women learn about their bodies, their needs during birth, and how to feel empowered with knowledge and understanding.  I love teaching women how to care for their bodies and improve their lives.  I have spent the last 20 years caring for laboring mothers and sick infants in the NICU.  I spent two years in the adult ICU setting further developing my skills.   I continued my education at the University of Utah where I studied midwifery and women’s health nurse practitioner specialties, earning my Doctoral degree. I feel that this course of study allows me to better care for women with the most up-to-date information, empowering women to make the best choices for their life.
I was born in Nevada and raised around the United States…an “Army brat”.  I have three boys, one girl, two grandchildren and the most supportive husband ever.  I spend my limited free time quilting, gardening, shopping and being outdoors.

I have practiced in Naperville for the past 10 years and although I have always pride myself on providing the utmost high quality up to date care, I have found that I have a niche in medicine, a knack for a more individualized higher level of healthcare. It has always been a dream of mine to take this special personalized attention and extend it to every aspect of the healthcare experience. And that combined with achieving extensive unique experience in my field, my goal is to give each client a luxury healthcare experience surpassed by none.
By now you have likely seen my “specialties” everywhere, the website, business cards, facebook, etc. There’s good reason for this. Although I enjoy seeing women to take care of all of their OB/Gyn needs, I have become particularly fond of those areas that help to improve your quality of life. It gives women a certain freedom when they don’t have to worry about becoming pregnant when their family is complete, an annoying period mishap at the most inopportune time, irritation from elongated labia minora during exercise or intercourse. I want to help give women their life back by taking care of those gynecological nuisances with minimally invasive in-office procedures without the risks of anesthesia. I always endeavor to provide these procedures not only with unsurpassed customer service but also in a way that will be least disruptive to your work and daily routines so that you can move on to enjoying your life.
Hobbies? Well, unfortunately for my amazingly wonderful husband Charles and two absolutely beautiful and sweet 3yo twins, this is my hobby. Right now, I promise you that I eat, drink, sleep, live and breathe bringing you the personalized luxury healthcare experience of a lifetime. But with your continued support, one day, I do plan to seriously get back to, first and foremost, spending time with family and friends and those other small delicacies of life I enjoy. Those include twizzlers, an occasional glass of Moscato, and a very unhealthy obsession for shoes.
Thank you so much for reading about me and I truly look forward to welcoming you to The Wright Center for Women’s Health.","drwright@thewrightobgyn.com","630-687-9595","adbf4844379d5523","1874","1026","2016-04-23","0","1","1","drwright@thewrightobgyn.com; Carrie@thewrightobgyn.com"

My initial experience as an advanced clinical provider was working in general medicine alongside family and internal medicine physicians so I am familiar with empowering patients to take charge of health concerns such as annual exams and chronic conditions such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes.  Additional assistance was provided in helping patients to meet weight management and smoking cessation goals.  I look forward to continued expansion of my healthcare experience by working with women’s health concerns such as annual and wellness exams, OB visits, as well as other concerns that require the attention of an advanced clinical provider.  In particular I look forward to focusing on helping patients meet weight management goals, and working on expanding the Center’s provision of alternative and integrative medicine regimens in particular with the management of balancing hormones and helping women to age healthier.
Outside of the clinic, I relax watching Big Bang Theory and Shonda Rhimes television (Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, anyone?) and playing games such as Words with Friends and Ruzzle.  
I am excited to join the team at the Wright Center for Women’s Health, and look forward to the challenge of working on healthcare goals with patients.

I left Fresno, California to attend the University of California Berkeley, where I double majored in science and humanitarian studies.  Since then, I have moved around the country and explored the world.  Following the footstep of my mother, who has been practicing family medicine, I attended medical school at Tufts University in Boston and earned MD and MBA degrees.  I completed my General Surgery residency at Loma Linda University Medical Center.  During my residency, my interest for reconstructive surgery grew immensely when I assisted in head and neck, trunk and breast reconstruction after big oncologic extirpation.  Following my interest, I trained at the University of Miami’s Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery program.  As I approached the end of my training, I developed an interest in being a well-rounded and complete surgeon, one who can treat and manage peripheral nerves, bone and joint diseases in addition to internal organs and soft tissues.  So, I pursued a hand fellowship at the University of California, Davis.
During my training at Loma Linda University, I have come to fall in love with Orange County.  I have made it my goal to return to the OC and practice here for the rest of my life. It is a fortuitous opening at the Mile Square Surgery Center that has landed me here.  At the MSSC, we excel at a wide array of surgical procedures ranging from rhinoplasty, craniofacial surgeries, head and neck surgeries, facial rejuvenation, breast surgeries, body contouring, genital surgeries to hand and upper extremities surgeries and many more.
I have created the General Reconstructive Aesthetic Plastic and Hand Surgery Incorporated institution (GRAPH Surgery Inc) for the sole purpose of delivering comprehensive care to my patients.
As your doctor, I understand how valuable your time is. And I want to let you know how much I appreciate the time you take to be as healthy as you can be. To thank you for all your hard work, to share our email Graphsurgery@gmail.com to make it easier for you and your family to get answers to your questions and take care of many of your health care needs.

“My passion lies in being a part of the transition to helping people look and feel their best when they feel they have nowhere else to turn. They have tried all the traditional medicine remedies where there is a pill for every ill and they have found little relief with unwanted side effects. Bio-identical Hormone pellet therapy is a natural approach to get their bodies back in tune with their optimal function without the negative side effects. I love to hear how the introduction of bio-identical hormones has given my patients back their sense of well being. I never get tired of hearing of the positive impact it’s made on both theirs and their families lives”

As a board-certified gynecologic surgeon for 20 years, Dr. Hayes has dedicated her life’s work to female-centric health care. She is a leader in both minimally invasive gynecologic surgery and vaginal plastic surgery and she was the first surgeon, worldwide, to combine robotic surgery with a cosmetic gyn procedure.
As a believer in bio-identical hormone and hormone optimization treatment, Dr. Hayes embraces 
BioTE bio-identical pellet therapy for both herself and her patients and sees it as a way for women to embrace their vitality and quality of life. At Visionary Centre for Women, you’ll be given the time necessary for us to understand your unique needs. Before beginning Pellet Therapy, factors are considered – age, weight, activity level, to name a few — so that a personalized treatment plan can be created. No two women are alike so why should your treatment?
A forward thinker, Dr. Hayes was the first GYN surgeon on Florida’s West Coast to offer and incorporate da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery into her practice, making her the longest experienced GYN surgeon for robotic solutions for prolapse, fibroids, endometriosis and heavy bleeding. As an innovator, Dr. Hayes was the first board-certified gynecologist to bring Cosmetic Gynecology to Tampa Bay. In 2007, she received her training in Beverly Hills at the prestigious Laser Vaginal Rejuvenation Institute of Beverly Hills. 
Dr. Hayes grew up in a family that valued the healing arts. Her father, a Pinellas County surgeon and her mother, a nurse, carried a profound respect for the medical journey from illness to wellness that she observed and now considers a great honor to be a part of. She completed her undergraduate degree at Florida Southern College in Lakeland, FL. She graduated, with honors, from Nova Southeastern University Medical School in Miami. Her Obstetrics and Gynecology specialty training were at Riverside Osteopathic Hospital in Michigan. She moved back to Florida to start her practice and then, in 2008 she stopped obstetrics and opened Visionary Centre for Women. She has been awarded the “Patient’s Choice” Award by her patients every years since. 
We’re dedicated to empowering women with knowledge, choice and alternatives–creating each patient’s vision of their health, well-being and sexual self-esteem and we’re passionate about helping patients create a healthy, comfortable and vibrant approach to life. I want patients to really get that essence the minute they walk through our doors. After all…we are all together on this journey called life.

McIntosh-Banya , DD MPAS PA, is a Nebraska native physician assistant with nearly two decades of OB/GYN clinical experience . She earned her doctorate from American Institute of Holistic Theology where her studies with Drs. Andrew Weil and Christine Northrup honed her holistic medicine approach. In addition, she had  intensive  hormone replacement  therapy training with Dr. Neil Rouzier. 

Her commitment to alternative health founded in her own personal challenge with traditional medicine. For six years, she apologized to patients for her cold hands and sat in her office with a heater on blast throughout the year. Many doctors recognized her symptoms as a thyroid condition.  When her thyroid lab tests showed normal range, she was denied  any treatment by several well respected doctors until finding a fellow colleague willing to prescribe bio-identical hormones including thyroid and testosterone.  Life with bio-identical hormones has gone from good  to GREAT!

Dr. Markeita L. McIntosh-Banya is the founder and CEO of Well Woman based in Atlanta, GA.   A sought - after transformational speaker on raising the awareness of your personal health and health related matters, she speaks to audiences around the country. She advocates that health integrates oneness of your spirit, mind and body  utilizing spiritual and scientific principles of healing.  She passionately delivers that message and is dedicated to empowering individuals and organizations to enjoy great health every day.  Patients and audiences alike resonate with her life saving clinical approach to real -time issues that affect their immediate and long term health.

She is the former CEO of Opportunities Unlimited.  Under her stewardship, the company became the first  Georgia Minority Supplier Diversity Council's health and wellness organization. She began Opportunities Unlimited as an independent contractor and later became the Clinical Director for several medical practices and was awarded a $8 million dollar government facility contract.

Over the years, Dr Mac has gained considerable respect and influence with patients and organizations as well as  her colleagues. Answering the nation's call to action with Saving Promise, she unified with her Atlanta community and the country in the national movement to change  intimate partner violence and sexual violence in America.   She tackles not so popular topics including sexual health and sexual well-being as a published medical journalist and medical liaison of the third largest laboratory in the United States, BioReference Laboratory located in New Jersey.  She builds personal health tool kits to grow, restore, and expand a legacy of positive health habits for families and communities.

As my interest in medicine grew I attended the University of Washington School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program graduating with honors in 2004. I chose to work in multiple areas of medicine including hematology/oncology with stem cell transplantation. In 2008, I completed a critical care fellowship from Oregon Health Sciences University. I provided care as an internist and in the ICU as well as volunteering in the homeless veterans’ clinic, and traveling to Mexico for medical mission work, until a debilitating accident in 2010. 
After years of pain, multiple surgeries, and countless procedures to repair fractures, nerve and soft tissue damage I sought out regenerative medicine experts. I was fortunate to experience first-hand the incredible capability of ultrasound diagnostics and the effects of regenerative medicine with cellular therapy and PRP injections. 
After regaining my health, I focused my education to support the evolving practice of cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine. In 2015 I became the first Physician Assistant to complete the Emergency Medicine Fellowship in Ultrasound, at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine and continued to volunteer teaching medical students and residents the clinical capabilities of ultrasound diagnostics. Since 2014 I have traveled all over southern California working with doctors preforming injections and utilizing ultrasound. 
My less conventional path continued, and I obtained training in bio-identical hormone replacement methods. I am passionate about bringing a full sense of vitality to our patients and utilized regenerative medicine for chronic pain, neuropathy, joint conditions, sexual health, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and anorgasmia. I find the combination of therapies to improve relationships and quality of life for many of my patients.
In November of 2017 West 2 North medical solutions opened its 4th location in San Marcos, California and I finally found my home and team to implement my dream of helping more people with cellular therapy and PRP.
I am passionate about treating the whole patient and acknowledge that life stress and hormone imbalances play a key role in the body’s inability to heal and can cause disease.  Our team is committed to assisting our patients,’ and community, in reaching their goals of healing, and continued health and longevity.

He is the past president of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine.

His goal in medicine to help people with chronic medical issues by using, as much as possible, physiologic approaches to improving the patients’ health. Drugs are necessary at times however, there are powerful methods available to help healing take place that are not dependent on drugs.  Relying mostly on what are sometimes thought of as “natural” methods is what is now defined as being “integrative medicine”. Dr. Wilkinson has been a pioneer in that developing field.  He also sought out BioTE Medical and became a certified provider as he saw it to be a fit in his practice to use as an additional tool to help his patient feel better and age healthier.

With close to 20 years of experience as an OB-GYN,  Dr. Feingold is recognized as an accomplished  professional in his field and highly respected among his peers. He is often one of the top choices for referral from Doctors and his existing patients often recommend him as the number one choice for pregnancy or new patient referrals.

Dr. Feingold has several patient’s that he has had the privilege of delivering 4 babies for.  He is now delivering babies for the patient’s he actually delivered!
His compassionate approach creates a comfortable welcoming environment for women facing important health concerns. Concerns that can often make women feel uneasy when facing first time medical junctures such as pregnancy, prenatal care, hormone imbalances, gynecologic surgery, menopause or other OB-GYN related issues that can occur over a woman's lifespan. 
This calm and caring demeanor creates a sense of comfort and well-being among his patients. His compassionate, caring bedside manner has earned him special recognition in 2016 by the Yavapai Regional Medical Foundation on National Doctors Day. 
Dr. Feingold encourages women to be active partners in their gynecological health. He encourages early dialog with women when discussing specific health concerns starting from adolescence all the way through to advanced aging.

As the former Chairman of the OB-GYN medical department, he understands the importance of patient inclusion for easing fears associated with unknown medical terminology or procedures.

In addition, he wants each woman to feel unconditional self-direction when making important medical choices. He also was recently awarded physician of the year for the highest use of progesterone to prevent preterm births.

He completed his residency at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan where he was awarded the residency teacher of the year award in 1995. 
He then returned to Arizona and joined Cigna Healthcare.   In 1998, Dr. Feingold relocated to Prescott, and since then has been serving the Tri City area for 18 years.
Today, his role at Women's Medical Care is to provide the highest quality care offered in Yavapai County. Working with a highly specialized team of board-certified professionals, Dr. Feingold wants both existing and new patients to feel they are receiving the excellence they deserve.

I started my medical career as a general surgeon in 2006 after graduating from the University of Illinois Metropolitan Group Hospital surgical residency shortly after Dr. Truong. For the next 10 years, I continued on to work full time as a general surgeon in the North Chicago area, eventually forming and leading the Precision Surgical Group, a team of highly skilled surgeons dedicated to the surgical needs of the community.
I was always the ""fat kid"" growing up, being constantly bullied and teased because of my weight. As I grew older, health problems started to become apparent because of my weight. With the passing of my close college friend due to heart problems (who was my age) and being a father and husband, I realized that I had to make a change. I educated myself heavily on nutrition and training, eventually discovering the critical importance of hormonal and vitamin optimization. *As a result, I became healthier and happier than I have ever been.
While out for a couple of drinks one day, Dr.Truong and I realized how a combination of our passions of body sculpting and bioidentical hormone therapy could really change a person, both inside and out.  Thus, XSCULPT was born!
I still practice general surgery because sometimes nothing beats curing the sick, but with *XSculpt I approach my patients as a whole and strive to prevent some of the potential sickness or reverse the process like I did for myself. Giving a person a sense of wellbeing and helping him or her achieve a healthy physique is unparalleled. 
XSculpt is my way of sharing with others what I feel I was able to accomplish for myself. Go XSculpt!

After graduating at the top of his high school class in Denver, Colorado, Dr. Truong was accepted to the University of Notre Dame on a full academic scholarship. He graduated from Notre Dame with a bachelor's degree, with a double-major in Pre-Medical Studies and English. He was awarded the prestigious designation of Notre Dame Scholar, given to only the top fifteen percent of each class.
Dr. Truong returned to Denver where he completed his medical studies at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. During his time here, Dr. Truong was encouraged to pursue a surgical career by his professors who saw in him the rare combination of intellect and talented hands that are the hallmarks of an excellent surgeon.
After completing his surgical internship at the University of Illinois Chicago's Metropolitan Group Hospitals, he completed an additional five years of general surgery training which included extensive experience in all areas of the human body, including complex cancer surgery, vascular surgery, trauma surgery, and minimally invasive surgery. His surgical training also included an entire year dedicated solely to the treatment of burn injuries at the Cook County Hospital Burn Center.
Dr. Truong served as Chief Resident at Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Lutheran General Hospital, Mercy Medical Center, and St. Francis Hospital.  During his surgical training, Dr. Truong received numerous awards and his research work in skin regeneration and artificial skin was published in medical journals.
Upon completion of general surgery training, Dr. Truong pursued his interests in aesthetic surgery by gaining acceptance to the highly competitive American Academy Cosmetic Surgery Fellowship. During his fellowship, Dr. Truong dedicated an entire year exclusively to the art and practice of Cosmetic Surgery. His training included facial rejuvenation techniques, breast and body restorative surgeries, liposuction and body sculpting, as well as minimally invasive aesthetic surgery and laser surgery.
Following his fellowship with the AACS, Dr. Truong completed a third year-long apprenticeship in aesthetic plastic surgery at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery in Chicago, Illinois. There he worked as an apprentice to Dr. Michael Byun, one of Chicago's most accomplished board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons. Under Dr. Byun's tutelage, Dr. Truong further honed his techniques in facial rejuvenation, breast and body enhancement, as well as laser surgery and skin care.
Dr. Truong holds medical licenses in  Illinois, New York, Florida, and Indiana.  He has been attending staff at numerous hospitals where he has operating and admitting privileges in cosmetic as well as general surgery.
Dr. Truong is double board-certified:  first by the American Board of Surgery (an ABMS board), and also by the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery which rigorously verifies and examines training and competency in the art and science of cosmetic surgery.
He is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a Fellow of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and a member of the American Society of Cosmetic Breast Surgery.
Dr. Truong has been featured in numerous local publications and was voted one of America’s top surgeons in the field of cosmetic surgery by the Consumer’s Research Council of America in 2012.

I was always the ""fat kid"" growing up, being constantly bullied and teased because of my weight. As I grew older, health problems started to become apparent because of my weight. With the passing of my close college friend due to heart problems (who was my age) and being a father and husband, I realized that I had to make a change. I educated myself heavily on nutrition and training, eventually discovering the critical importance of hormonal and vitamin optimization. *As a result, I became healthier and happier than I have ever been.
While out for a couple of drinks one day, Dr.Truong and I realized how a combination of our passions of body sculpting and bioidentical hormone therapy could really change a person, both inside and out.  Thus, XSCULPT was born!
I still practice general surgery because sometimes nothing beats curing the sick, but with *XSculpt I approach my patients as a whole and strive to prevent some of the potential sickness or reverse the process like I did for myself. Giving a person a sense of wellbeing and helping him or her achieve a healthy physique is unparalleled. 
XSculpt is my way of sharing with others what I feel I was able to accomplish for myself. Go XSculpt!

He was awarded the prestigious designation of Notre Dame Scholar, given to only the top fifteen percent of each class.
Dr. Truong returned to Denver where he completed his medical studies at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. During his time here, Dr. Truong was encouraged to pursue a surgical career by his professors who saw in him the rare combination of intellect and talented hands that are the hallmarks of an excellent surgeon.
After completing his surgical internship at the University of Illinois Chicago's Metropolitan Group Hospitals, he completed an additional five years of general surgery training which included extensive experience in all areas of the human body, including complex cancer surgery, vascular surgery, trauma surgery, and minimally invasive surgery. His surgical training also included an entire year dedicated solely to the treatment of burn injuries at the Cook County Hospital Burn Center.
Dr. Truong served as Chief Resident at Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Lutheran General Hospital, Mercy Medical Center, and St. Francis Hospital.  During his surgical training, Dr. Truong received numerous awards and his research work in skin regeneration and artificial skin was published in medical journals.
Upon completion of general surgery training, Dr. Truong pursued his interests in aesthetic surgery by gaining acceptance to the highly competitive American Academy Cosmetic Surgery Fellowship. During his fellowship, Dr. Truong dedicated an entire year exclusively to the art and practice of Cosmetic Surgery. His training included facial rejuvenation techniques, breast and body restorative surgeries, liposuction and body sculpting, as well as minimally invasive aesthetic surgery and laser surgery.
Following his fellowship with the AACS, Dr. Truong completed a third year-long apprenticeship in aesthetic plastic surgery at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery in Chicago, Illinois. There he worked as an apprentice to Dr. Michael Byun, one of Chicago's most accomplished board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons. Under Dr. Byun's tutelage, Dr. Truong further honed his techniques in facial rejuvenation, breast and body enhancement, as well as laser surgery and skin care.
Dr. Truong holds medical licenses in  Illinois, New York, Florida, and Indiana.  He has been attending staff at numerous hospitals where he has operating and admitting privileges in cosmetic as well as general surgery.
Dr. Truong is double board-certified:  first by the American Board of Surgery (an ABMS board), and also by the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery which rigorously verifies and examines training and competency in the art and science of cosmetic surgery.
He is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a Fellow of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and a member of the American Society of Cosmetic Breast Surgery.
Dr. Truong has been featured in numerous local publications and was voted one of America’s top surgeons in the field of cosmetic surgery by the Consumer’s Research Council of America in 2012.
From 2007 to 2014, Dr. Truong built Tampa Bay Surgical Arts into one of the most highly regarded cosmetic surgery practices in the Tampa Bay area, performing thousands of cosmetic surgery procedures.

I graduated residency in 1997 and took a position with a physician-owned clinic to develop a Family Practice Department at a newly opened satellite in Hartford, Wisconsin.  From outset, my practice flourished. Building a practice, providing quality patient care, and developing my skills as a Family Physician were all personally enriching.  I learned more about taking care of people during the first 5 years of practice than my entire 4 years in medical school and 3 years of residency.   In addition, I have earned Board Certifications in both Urgent Care and Family Practice.
There are a few extremely important aspects of caring for people that I consider non-negotiable.  1. A doctor needs to be easily accessible to the patient. 2. A doctor must be able to see the patient when they are both healthy and sick. 3.  A doctor must be able to take his/her time when caring for another human being.  Take away any of these, and I could no longer care for a person as their primary care physician.  
Each of these elements is based upon fostering an authentic provider/patient relationship – one in which the physician has the time to appreciate the patient as a unique human person – and is aware of the complexities of each individual’s situation. Take away any of these non-negotiable elements, and I could no longer care for a person as their primary care physician. Over the years, as both my own practice style has matured and the business of medicine has evolved, I have found that my commitment to providing high-quality patient-care, within the context of a genuine provider/patient relationship, is a standard that I cannot compromise.
Medicine is more of an art than a science.  Each person has a unique personality with inimitable strengths, weaknesses and problems.  There is no ""cookie-cutter""
